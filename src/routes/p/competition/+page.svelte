<p>Our writer is using meaning (1), but I think he should be using meaning (2). First of all it's difficult to imagine <b><i>a competition</i></b>, like the Olympic Games, 'increasing'. What does that mean? Does it mean more countries are taking part? Or more people are taking part? Or more events are included now? And anyway, who would consider any of these increases to be 'negative'?</p>

<p>I think the writer means this:</p>

<p class="alert alert-success font-italic">There is <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">increasing competition</span> which results in several negative effects.</p>
