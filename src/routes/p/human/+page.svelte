    <p>If we check in a dictionary, we see that <b><i>human</i></b> can be an adjective, as in 'human being' and it can be a noun, as in 'humans are destroying the planet'. In the example above, human is used as a noun.</p>

    <p>If we check again in the dictionary, we see that <b><i>human</i></b> is a countable noun. In grammar, we know that if we’re talking about all examples of a thing, everywhere, and the thing is countable, then we must add an ‘s’ to the noun:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">There will be many disadvantages for <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">humans</span> if animal testing is stopped.</div>

    <p>Mistakes are often made when human is used as a noun modifier, in which case the ‘s’ might be added to the <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic text-primary">main noun</span>, but <span class="uli">not</span> to <b><i>human</i></b>:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic mb-1">There will be many disadvantages for human <span class="font-weight-bold text-primary">beings</span> if animal testing is stopped.</div>
