    <h1><i>Most</i> or <i>Most of</i>..?</h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">Most of</span> older teachers and <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">some</span> younger teachers are not technology literate.</div>

    <p>Today I'm going to give you a task!</p>

    <p>Take a look at <a href="https://skell.sketchengine.eu/#result?lang=en&query=most%20of&f=concordance" target="_blank">these sentences</a> and try to identify any words or phrases that follow <b>most of</b>.</p>

    <p>Then compose a rule that explains why "Most of older teachers.." is incorrect. Share your rule with a teacher or a friend!</p>

    <p>Then think about why "<span class="font-weight-bold text-success">some</span> younger teachers" is correct. Does the rule for most/most of also apply to some/some of?</p>

</div>
