    <h1>Despite / In spite of</h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">Despite of</span> its advantages, technology has caused a wide range of social problems.</div>

    <p>This error is understandable. Both items serve the same purpose, but you need to be careful with the preposition:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">
        <p class="my-0"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Despite</span> its advantages, technology has caused a wide range of social problems.</p>
        <p class="my-0"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">In spite of</span> its advantages, technology has caused a wide range of social problems.</p>
    </div>

    <p>A safer, but slightly less sophisticated way to say this would be:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">
        <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Although it has advantages, technology has caused a wide range of social problems.</span>
    </div>
        <WithIcon icon="flag" position="right" msg="Indonesian students notice there is no 'akan tetapi' after the comma." />

</div>
