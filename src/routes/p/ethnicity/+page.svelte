    <p>This is one of those situations where the English word has been <b><i>borrowed</i></b> and its use altered. In this case the adjective form of the word has been used as a noun.</p>

    <p>English offers two word forms:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>ethnic (adjective)</li>
        <li>ethnicity (noun)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">
        <p class="mt-0">Different <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">ethnic groups</span> have different ways to communicate.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">People with different <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">ethnicity</span> have different ways to communicate.</p>

    <h3 class="mb-0">A question..</h3>
    <p class="mt-0">How do you describe your own ethnicity?</p>
