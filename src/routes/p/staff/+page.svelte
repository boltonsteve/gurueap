    <h1>You are not a <b><i>staff!</i></b></h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic">I am <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">a staff</span> at the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</div>

    <p><b><i>Staff</i></b> is a complicated word in English. This post demonstrates the various uses of <b><i>staff</i></b>, and indicates which uses are best for IELTS and also which uses are best avoided.</p>

    <h3><b><i>Staff</i></b> - singular countable noun</h3>

    <p>If you use <b><i>staff</i></b> as a singular countable noun, then you are probably not referring to someone who is a worker.</p>

    <p>Used as a singular countable noun, <b><i>a staff</i></b> is a kind of stick with certain features and functions:</p>

    <img src="/img/not-a-staff.png" class="pl-1" alt="not a staff" style="width:180px;float:right;">

    <ul class="lh-15">
        <li>often very long - longer than its user is tall</li>
        <li>usually made of wood</li>
        <li>usually quite ornate, possibly hand-crafted</li>
        <li>used by someone with special powers, for example a wizard</li>
        <li>often used in specialised fighting, like kung fu</li>
        <li>otherwise used to assist in walking (elderly people, etc)</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">He used his <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">staff</span> to scare away evil spirits and then used it to turn my horse into a brand new Ferrari. I noticed <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">the staff</span> also helped him to walk!</div>

    <h3><b><i>Staffs</i></b> - plural countable with 's'</h3>

    <p>Used as a plural countable noun with 's', <b><i>staffs</i></b> means more than one staff (= more than one wooden stick!):</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">Our company manufactures <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">staffs</span> for wizards.</div>

    <p>You are <span class="uli">extremely unlikely</span> to need this meaning in the IELTS test!</p>

    <h3><b><i>Staff</i></b> - plural countable <span class="uli">without</span> 's'</h3>

    <p>Used as a plural countable noun <span class="uli">without</span> 's', <b><i>staff</i></b> refers to people who work for a particular organisation, or within a particular department:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success mb-2">
        <ul class="font-italic lh-15 my-0">
            <li><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Staff</span> at the Ministry of Religious Affairs receive a competitive salary.</li>
            <li>Our trained pool <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">staff</span> are always present.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="mt-0">Notice the subject verb/agreement:</p>
    <ul class="my-0">
        <li><i>staff..receive</i> (<span class="uli">not</span> <i>receives</i>)</li>
        <li><i>staff..are present</i> (<span class="uli">not</span> <i>is present</i>)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the context of IELTS writing, you will probably be talking about people working for a particular company or organisation, and so you will probably never need to write 'a staff' or 'staffs'.</p>

    <h3><b><i>Staff</i></b> - <span class="uli">uncountable</span></h3>

    <p>This is <span class="uli">extremely uncommon</span>. It refers to a <i>component</i> of a company or organisation, just as you might refer to other components: accommodation, infrastructure, production, shipping, etc.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success mb-2">
        <ul class="lh-15 my-0">
            <li class="font-italic mb-0">The <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">staff</span> is spread across four campuses.</li>
            <li class="lst-none mt-0"><span class="small">all workers as a single group or 'component'</span></li>
            <li class="font-italic">The financial services <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">staff</span> mainly handles payment postings.</li>
            <li class="lst-none"><span class="small">all workers belonging to a sub-category (financial services) of a larger group or component (all workers)</span></li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="alert alert-danger">
        <p class="mt-0">Notice the subject verb/agreement:</p>
        <ul class="my-0">
            <li><i>the staff..is</i> (<span class="uli">not</span> <i>are</i>)</li>
            <li><i>the staff..handles</i> (<span class="uli">not</span> <i>handle</i>)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p>Again, this use of <b><i>staff</i></b> (uncountable) is extremely rare and I suggest <span class="uli">not</span> using it in IELTS.</p>

    <p>In IELTS speaking and writing use <span class="uli"><b><i>staff</i></b> plural countable without 's'</span>:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Staff</span> at the Ministry of Religious Affairs receive a competitive salary.</div>

    <p>If you really must use a plural countable noun with 's', you can do this:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">I am <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">a member of staff</span> at the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</div>

</div>
