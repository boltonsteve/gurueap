    <h1>As 'sebagai'</h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic mb-2">People call this <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">as</span> the ‘big data era’.</div>

    <WithIcon icon="flag" position="right" msg="In Bahasa Indonesia <b><i>disebut</i></b> (called) collocates strongly with <b><i>sebagai</i></b> (as). Not so in English. Indeed, sebagai is often redundant in English, except when it collocates with certain verbs." />


<p>The correct options here are:</p>

<div class="alert alert-success">
    <ol class="py-0 my-0">
        <li>People call this the ‘big data era’. (active <b><i>call</i></b> without <b><i>as</i></b>)</li>
        <li>This era is called the ‘big data era’. (passive <b><i>call</i></b> without <b><i>as</i></b>)</li>
        <li>This era is known as the ‘big data era’. (passive <b><i>know</i></b> with <b><i>as</i></b>)</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<p>Most native speakers would probably use number 1, except when the term being introduced is somehow scientific:</p>

<div class="alert alert-success font-italic">Liquids tend to travel quickly along very narrow spaces. This phenomenon <b>is known as</b> capillary attraction.</div>

<p>Be careful. If you want to use known as then you need to begin with some of the defining characteristics of the ‘known’ phenomenon:</p>

<div class="alert alert-success font-italic mb-2">Recently data has become so complex that traditional data processing application software is inadequate to deal with it. This data <b>is now known as</b> ‘big data’.</div>

    <WithIcon icon="flag" position="right" msg="Once again, be careful with <b><i>sebagai</i></b>! It collocates differently in English." />

</div>
