    <h1>The Impact Song</h1>

    <p>I've covered this collocation problem in a previous post. Students' first language drives them to produce 'bring an impact to/for'.</p>

    <p>I thought that by writing a song featuring the correct collocation, they might be brainwashed into getting it right next time.</p>

    <p>I'll get back to you when I've seen some writing 'post-song'!</p>
