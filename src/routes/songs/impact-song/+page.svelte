    <h1>The Impact Song</h1>

    <p>I've covered this collocation problem in <a href="../posts/impact" target="_blank">a previous post</a>. Students' first language drives them to produceÂ 'bring an impact to/for'.</p>

    <h3>Lyrics</h3>

    <p>
        You have an impact on me<br>
        I have an impact on you<br>
        We have an impact<br>
        An impact on each other<br>
        And on other people, too
    </p>

    <p>
        I have an impact on you<br>
        You have an impact on me<br>
        We have an impact<br>
        An impact on each other<br>
        We are 6-week family
    </p>

    <p>
        A positive impact makes us happy<br>
        A negative impact makes us sad<br>
        An impact on each other<br>
        Just like sister and brother<br>
        It's the best impact we've ever had
    </p>

    <p>
        ..on<br>
        ..impact on<br>
        ..an impact on<br>
        ..have an impact on<br>
        x2
    </p>

    <p>
        A positive impact makes us happy<br>
        A negative impact makes us sad<br>
        An impact on each other<br>
        Just like sister and brother<br>
        It's the best impact we've ever had
    </p>

    <p>
        It's the best impact we've ever had - Yeah..<br>
        It's the best impact we've ever had - Yeah..<br>
        It's the best impact we've ever had - YEAH!
    </p>
