    <h1>Lemon Squeezy</h1>

    <p>This song features EAP students preparing for postgraduate study in Australia. The focus is on collocations when using the words <b><i>easy</i></b> and <b><i>difficult</i></b>.</p>

    <p>As you will notice, neither of these words is easy!</p>

    <h3>Lemon Squeezy - Lyrics</h3>

    <p>It’s difficult / It’s easy It’s hard / Lemon squeezy</p>

    <p>It’s difficult for me to learn vocabulary <br>
        My dictionary doesn’t help at all <br>
        I look up a word that I’ve never seen or heard<br>
        But later it’s not easy to recall</p>

    <p>I have difficulty knowing which article to use.<br>
        Does it need an ‘s’? Should I even care?<br>
        Do I mean ‘one of many?’ ‘This one exactly?’<br>
        Or ‘all of them everywhere?’</p>

    <p>It’s difficult / It’s easy It’s hard / Lemon squeezy</p>

    <p>Some people make a note of any new words they see<br>
        They review the words regularly<br>
        They add information about collocation <br>
        And soon they write effortlessly</p>

    <p>It’s difficult / It’s easy It’s hard / Lemon squeezy</p>

    <p>My friends find it easier than me<br>
        To learn new vocabulary<br>
        They use a different strategy</p>

    <p>Speak English with your friends<br>
        Evenings and weekends<br>
        It’s easier that way <br>
        You don’t even have to pay</p>

    <p>It’s easy.. Lemon squeezy..</p>
