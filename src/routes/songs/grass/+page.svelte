        The grass springs up to meet the air coming down<br>
        And that's a good idea<br>
        For if the grass laid low<br>
        The air would have to come down the extra amount
    </p>

    <p>
        Cos there's got to be something there<br>
        Cos there's got to be something there all the time<br>
        Cos there's got to be something there all the time<br>
        Cos there's got to be something there
    </p>

        When my father was young and my mother was young<br>
        And I was a very little lad<br>
        They took me out to the middle of a field<br>
        And there did something bad
    </p>

    <p>
        They took my body and they pressed it down<br>
        Til they made the grass quite flat<br>
        And the poor old air had to fall much more <br>
        Cos the grass was as flat as a bat
    </p>

    <p>
        Flat as a bat<br>
        Flat as a bat<br>
        Flat as the wing of a bat
    </p>

    <p>
        Now whenever I stand in a field of grass<br>
        With the cool blue wind at my chest<br>
        I smile around at the four foot grass<br>
        For I reckon four foot grass is the best
    </p>

    <p>
        You should see how happy the air is<br>
        It doesn't have far to go<br>
        I'm going to stand in the middle of the field<br>
        Til it begins to grow
    </p>

    <p>
        Then I'll lie down, Then I'll lie down<br>
        When it begins to grow.
