    <h1>In terms of #2</h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">In terms of reliability</span>, it could be argued that renewable energy devices are unlikely to play an important role in system <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">reliability</span>.</div>

    <p>In <a href="../posts/in-terms-of" target="_blank">another post</a> we looked at the usefulness of the phrase <a href="../posts/in-terms-of" target="_blank">in terms of</a> as a way to introduce the main topic of a paragraph, in particular an argument paragraph, but also in IELTS Task 1 and Task 2 writing.</p>

    <WithIcon icon="warning">
        <div slot="html">However, we only really need to use <b><i>in terms of</i></b> if we haven't already used it somewhere else in the sentence.</div>
    </WithIcon>

    <p>In the example above, the central topic would be clear to the reader even without <b><i>in terms of</i></b>:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">It could be argued that renewable energy devices are unlikely to play an important role in system <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">reliability</span>.</div>
