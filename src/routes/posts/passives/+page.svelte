    <p>Here the reader will stop at applied and think "Huh?! A protocol (subject) applied something (object)? But that's impossible!"</p>

            In Bahasa Indonesia there is a <b><i>passive</i></b> form but it does not include <b><i>to be</i></b>. Indonesians should make a habit of chanting the rhyme 'to be + verb 3 is best for me, to be + verb 3 is best for me, to be + verb 3 is best for me!' 
        </div>
    </WithIcon>

    <p>How about if we include <b><i>to be</i></b> in the pasive?</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">A strict protocol <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">is applied</span> in order to ensure safety for human consumption.</div>
