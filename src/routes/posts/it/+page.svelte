    <h1>Use 'it' with care!</h1>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">People who live in remote areas sometimes have limited access to the things they want to buy. Since <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">it</span> cannot be provided by retail shops, online shopping may be the solution.</p>

    <p>To make your writing 'flow', so that pieces of information connect together well, use <b><i>it</i></b> only when <b><i>it</i></b> refers back to the subject of the previous sentence.</p>

    <p>When you use <b><i>it</i></b> then the subject will be either singular countable or uncountable:</p>

    <ul class="lh-15 font-italic">
        <li>My watch was expensive. <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">It</span> is a gold watch. I love <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">it</span>.</li>
        <li>Beer is delicious. <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">It</span> is also expensive. I love <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">it</span>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In the opening example (below heading), the reader searches for but cannot find a subject to match <b><i>it</i></b>. For a start, all of the nouns are plural!</p>

    <p>After re-reading the text two or three times we see the writer is using <b><i>it</i></b> to refer to 'the things people want to buy', which is rather confusing since 'the things people want to buy' is not the subject of the previous sentence and it is neither singular countable nor uncountable.</p>

    <p>This kind of mismatch interrupts the flow of information in the text and brings down your score for coherence and cohesion in IELTS writing, as well as your score for fluency in IELTS speaking.</p>

    <p>In order to maintain 'flow' in the online shopping example, you need to do this:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">People who live in remote areas sometimes have limited access to the things they want to buy. Since <b><i>the things that people who live in remote areas want to buy</i></b> cannot be provided by retail shops, online shopping may be the solution.</p>

    <p>And for even better flow you can remind your reader about <b><i>the context of those retail shops</i></b>. After all, you're not talking about retail shops in the middle of a large city, are you?</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">People who live in remote areas sometimes have limited access to the things they want to buy. Since the things that people who live in remote areas want to buy cannot be provided by <b><i>retail shops in those areas</i></b>, online shopping may be the solution.</p>

    <p>Students often complain, <i>"..but now there's a lot of repetition!"</i></p>

    <p>Perhaps, but your first priority is to communicate effectively. If the only way to achieve this is by repeating a few words, then you MUST repeat them.</p>

    <p>And remember - <b><i>it</i></b> refers back to the subject of the previous sentence or verb phrase. Do not make this kind of mistake:</p>
