    <h1>Each and every ONE of them</h1>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">Every people</span> can access their own social media account with the touch of a finger.</p>

    <p>This is partly forgivable. We know that millions of people (= millions of fingers) use social media, and this writer is making a statement that applies to all of these people. However, there is some faulty grammar:</p>

<ul class="font-italic">
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Every</span> field is going through rapid change.</li>
    <li>The crowds were getting worse <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">every</span> minute!</li>
    <li>These days every genre is using <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">every</span> sound.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Every</i></b> + field, minute, genre, sound (singular, even though we're thinking about all field<span class="uli">s</span>, minute<span class="uli">s</span>, genre<span class="uli">s</span>, sound<span class="uli">s</span>!)</p>

<p>I know. It's crazy. And the same applies to <b><i>each</i></b>:</p>

<ul class="font-italic">
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Each</span> correct answer is worth 10 points.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Each</span> room contains high speed wireless internet access.</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Each</span> drink contains 108 calories.</li>
</ul>

<p class="small"><b><i>Each</i></b> + answer, room, drink<br>
    (singular, even though we're thinking about all answers, rooms, drinks!)</p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>

    <p>Returning to our opening example we at least need:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Every person</span> can access their own social media account with the touch of a finger.</p>

    <p>However, when we're talking about people it is much more common to use words like <i>everyone</i> or <i>anybody</i>:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Everybody</span> can access their own social media account with the touch of a finger.</p>

    <p>Finally, a common expression used to emphasise all of them is:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Each</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">every</span> one of them.</p>

    <p class="ml-3 small"><b><i>Each</i></b> + one; <b><i>Every</i></b> + one!</p>
