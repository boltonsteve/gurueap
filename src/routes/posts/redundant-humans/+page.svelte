    <h1>Humans are usually redundant</h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic">In conclusion, long working hours are necessary <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">for human beings</span>.</div>

    <WithIcon icon="flag" position="right" msg="In Indonesian writing culture, humans are mentioned often. This is not the case in written English." />

    <p class="mt-0">Let’s try a quick test. Which of the following sentences is <b><i>NOT</i></b> about working hours and humans?</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Long working hours are necessary for human beings.</li>
        <li>Long working hours are necessary.</li>
        <li>Long working hours are necessary for ants.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Hopefully you chose number 3. In any discussion of working hours, and indeed of many other topics, we’re usually talking about human beings, <em><strong>unless otherwise specified</strong></em>.</p>

    <p>The only time we really need to mention humans is <span class="uli">when we have a need to contrast them with non-humans</span>:</p>

    <img src="../img/redundant-humans.jpg" class="img-fluid mx-auto" alt="redundant humans" style="width:75%;">

    <p>If I'm describing a manufacturing process from assembly to shipping, I would simply write:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">Finally, goods are packaged ready for distribution.</div>

    <p>In this case there is no need to mention the people/robots doing the packaging (often referred to as the <i>doer</i> or the <i>agent</i>). Notice I used <i>passive voice</i> (to be + V3) in order to achieve this.</p>

    <p>However, if I'm writing about automation and the threat to employment, I might write:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">In the automated process, goods are no longer packaged <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">by humans</span>. There are now <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">robots</span> for this purpose.</div>

    <p>Here it is reasonable to mention the <i>doer</i>, or <i>agent</i>, since the <i>doer</i> - in this case robots - plays a key role in a social shift from human-powered to automated labour.</p>
