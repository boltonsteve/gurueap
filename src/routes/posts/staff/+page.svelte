    <h1>You are not <b><i>a staff!</i></b></h1>

    <p>I am <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">a staff</span> at the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p>

    <p>Although you will occasionally find an example of <b><i>staff</i></b> as a countable noun, it is <span class="uli">extremely rare</span>.</p>

    <p>Used as an uncountable noun, <b><i>staff</i></b> refers to people who work for a particular organisation:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Staff</span> at the Ministry of Religious Affairs receive a competitive salary.</p>

    <p>Used as a countable noun, <b><i>a staff</i></b> is a kind of stick with certain features and functions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>often very long - longer than its user is tall</li>
    <li>usually made of wood</li>
    <li>usually quite ornate, possibly hand-crafted</li>
    <li>used by someone with special powers, for example a wizard</li>
    <li>often used in specialised fighting, like kung fu</li>
    <li>otherwise used to assist in walking (elderly people, etc)</li>
</ul>

<p class="font-italic">He used his <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">staff</span> to scare away evil spirits and then used it to turn my horse into a brand new Ferrari. I noticed <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">the staff</span> also helped him to walk!</p>

<p>In the context of your writing, one of these meanings - staff countable / staff uncountable - will probably be more obvious than the other. However, if you want a high score in IELTS for vocabulary, I suggest you choose the most appropriate meaning!</p>

<p>If you really must use a countable noun, you can do this:</p>

<p class="ml-3 font-italic">I am <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">a member of staff</span> at the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p>
