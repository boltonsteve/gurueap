    <p class="mb-0">But in order to <b><i>memorise</i></b> anything, a photograph would require consciousness, which is of course impossible. A photograph does not have a brain:</p>

    <p class="mt-0">Only humans can <em><strong>memorise</strong></em> things, so perhaps you mean:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">I keep my photos because they help me to <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">remember</span> the moment.</div>

    <p>Be careful with <em><strong>memorise</strong></em>. We don’t usually <em><strong>memorise</strong></em> 'moments'. We generally <em><strong>memorise</strong></em> 'information', and this often requires continued and intensive concentration. For example if you want to <em><strong>remember</strong></em> somebody’s phone number, you must first of all <em><strong> memorise</strong></em> it. The <em><strong>memory</strong></em> of the number then stays in your head ready for the next time you need it. With a photograph, the <em><strong>memory</strong></em> might not stay in your head. Rather, you <em><strong>remember</strong></em> the moment whenever you look at the photograph. In this sense the photo acts as a <em><strong>reminder</strong></em>.</p>
