    <h1>(the) Society</h1>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">Unemployment is one of the most serious problems for <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">the society</span> today.</p>

    <p>The problem here is that <b>the society</b> (with 'the') has quite a different meaning to <b>society</b> (without 'the').</p>
    <h3 class="mb-0">without 'the'</h3>
    <p class="mt-1">If you're talking about all of humanity as a collective, then you're probably talking about <b>society. </b>In this case you're probably thinking about the whole of the human race at a particular time, usually around now. If problems are faced by <b>society</b> (without 'the'), then they are likely to be problems that <i>all people</i> face, either across an entire country, or possibly all over the world, and so in this case you need:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">Unemployment is one of the most serious problems for <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">society</span> today.</p>

    <h3 class="mb-0">with 'the'</h3>
    <p class="mt-1">On the other hand if you're talking about a specific group of people who have some kind of shared set of specific interests then you need <b>the society.</b> For example in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_learned_societies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">list of academic 'societies'</a>, group members relate to each other because they share the same academic interests. Similarly, universities often have <a href="http://www.sun.ac.za/english/students/student-societies/cultural-hobby-societies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">societies devoted to particular hobbies or interests</a>. In this case you might be writing something like:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">In our university <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">the</span> <span class="uli">most popular</span> <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">society</span> is <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">the</span> <span class="uli">photographic</span> <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">society</span>. <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">The society</span> has 600 members.</p>

    <p>Notice that in this example, not only do we use 'the' to show that we are talking about a specific group, but we also use words to modify the word <b>society</b> so that our reader understands exactly which group we're talking about ('most popular', 'photographic').</p>

    <p>So, be careful next time you use <b>society</b>! :)</p>
