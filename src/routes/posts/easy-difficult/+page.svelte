    <h1>Easy can be difficult</h1>

    <p class="font-italic ml-3">Animals that perform in circuses <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">are easy to</span> get tired.</p>

    <p>If we reduce this to its most basic grammar, we get:</p>

 	<p class="font-italic ml-3">Animals are easy.</p>

    <p>I don't think that's what the writer intended. Let's look at some examples!</p>

 	<ul class="lh-15">
 	    <li class="font-italic">My answer was pretty easy to understand.</li>
 	    <li class="mt-0 lst-none small">= My answer was easy.</li>
 	    <li class="font-italic">The daily instructions are very easy to follow.</li>
 	    <li class="mt-0 lst-none small">= The daily instructions are easy.</li>
 	    <li class="font-italic">The game is really pretty easy to play.</li>
 	    <li class="mt-0 lst-none small">= The game is easy.</li>
 	</ul>

    <p>Now contrast the previous examples with the following.</p>

 	<ul class="lh-15">
 	    <li class="font-italic">Generally it is easier for men to handle horses.</li>
 	    <li class="mt-0 lst-none small">= Handling horses is easy (NOT men are easy!)</li>
 	    <li class="font-italic">It is easy for smartphone users to use QR codes.</li>
 	    <li class="mt-0 lst-none small">= Using QR codes is easy (NOT smartphone users are easy!)</li>
 	    <li class="font-italic">It is easy for people to misunderstand religious language and ritual.</li>
 	    <li class="mt-0 lst-none small">= Misunderstanding is easy (NOT people are easy!)</li>
 	</ul>

    <p>Returning to our previous example, we can fix it (easily!) if we begin with <b><i>It is easy for..</i></b>:</p>

 	<p class="font-italic ml-3"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">It is easy for</span> animals that perform in circuses to become tired.</p>

    <p class="font-weight-bold ml-3">it is easy/difficult for + noun + to + V1</p>

    <p>This structure is also featured in the song by GuruEAP <a href="../songs/lemon-squeezy" target="_blank">Lemon Squeezy</a>. Check it out!</p>

    <p>An alternative improvement would be to use an adverb:</p>

    <p class="font-italic ml-3">Animals that are used to perform become tired <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">easily</span>.</p>

    <p>..and for an even higher IELTS score, avoid 'become' by using the verb form of 'tired':</p>

    <p class="font-italic ml-3">Animals that are used to perform <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">tire easily</span>.</p>
