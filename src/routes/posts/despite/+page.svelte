    <h1>Despite / In spite of</h1>

    <p class="font-italic ml-3"><span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">Despite of</span> its advantages, technology has caused a wide range of social problems.</p>

    <p class="font-italic ml-3"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Despite</span> its advantages, technology has caused a wide range of social problems.</p>
