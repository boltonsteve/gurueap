    <h1>Captive and captivating in captivity</h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic">It is not good to capture animals from the natural environment and put them in one place like a <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">captivated</span> area.</div>

    <p>To make this gramatically correct, a different word form is needed:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">It is not good to capture animals from the natural environment and put them in one place like a <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">captivity</span> area.</div>

    <p>It is unusual to refer to places like zoos as 'captivity areas'. However, there are several forms of the same word that can be useful when talking about animals.</p>

    <p>Take a look at the photo at the top of this post. Then read the text below. Discuss with a friend how you would translate the words in bold in your own language.</p>

    <p>The panda is <b><i>in captivity</i></b>. It was <b><i>captured</i></b> and is now <b><i>held captive</i></b> in a zoo. A young boy is admiring the panda through a glass screen. The boy is <b><i>captivated</i></b> by the panda. The panda is beautiful. Its beauty is <b><i>captivating</i></b>.</p>
