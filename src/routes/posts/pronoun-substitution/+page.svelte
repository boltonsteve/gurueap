    <h1>Pronoun substitution and an alternative</h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic">When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">They</span> can try clothes on and know what materials were used.</div>

    <p>Almost! But..</p>

    <p>A personal pronoun at the beginning of a sentence refers back to the subject of the previous sentence, and in this case the subject of the previous sentence is <b><i>the goods</i></b>. <i>When people go to real shops</i> is an adverb phrase. So obviously that doesnt make sense: "The goods can try clothes on!?"</p>

    <p>If you want to use <b><i>They</i></b> as a substitute for <b><i>the goods</i></b>, that's tricky but not impossible:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. <b><i>They</i></b> can be touched, and the material from which <b><i>they</i></b> were made can be seen and felt.</div>

    <p>But that's probably not what you wanted. You wanted <b><i>People</i></b> as the subject of the second sentence, right? In that case you simply need to state the subject in the second sentence:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">People</span> can try clothes on and know what materials were used.</div>

    <p>Now you have nice cohesion between the two sentences, with <b><i>people</i></b> in both sentences. However, to make your writing more coherent you could be more specific about people:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">People in real shops</span> can try clothes on and know what materials were used.</div>

    <p>And finally to avoid repetition you can do this:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Customers in real shops</span> can try clothes on and know what materials were used.</div>

    <p>So in fact you didn't need to use pronoun substitution. Instead the two sentences are glued together (cohesive) thanks to the use of <b><i>people (who) go to real shops</i></b> in sentence 1 and <b><i>customers in real shops</i></b> in sentence 2.</p>

    <p>You could probably also use a synonym for <b><i>real</i></b> in sentence 2, but I can't think of one. Can you?</p>
