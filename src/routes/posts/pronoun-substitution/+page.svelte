<div class="mb-3 mw-500">

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic">When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">They</span> can try clothes on and know what materials were used.</div>

    <p>Almost! But..</p>

    <p>A personal pronoun at the beginning of a sentence refers back to the subject of the previous sentence, and in this case the subject of the previous sentence is <b><i>the goods</i></b>. <i>When people go to real shops</i> is an adverb phrase. So obviously that doesnt make sense: "The goods can try clothes on!?"</p>

    <p>If you want to use <b><i>They</i></b> as a substitute for <b><i>the goods</i></b>, that's tricky but not impossible:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. <b><i>They</i></b> can be touched, and the material from which <b><i>they</i></b> were made can be seen and felt.</div>

But that's probably not what you wanted. You wanted People as the subject of the second sentence, right? In that case you simply need to state the subject in the second sentence:

When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. People can try clothes on and know what materials were used.

Now you have nice cohesion between the two sentences, with people in both sentences. However, to make your writing more coherent you could be more specific about people:

When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. People in real shops can try clothes on and know what materials were used.

And finally to avoid repetition you can do this:

When people go to real shops, the goods are visible. Customers in real shops can try clothes on and know what materials were used.

So in fact you didn't need to use pronoun substitution. Instead the two sentences are glued together (cohesive) thanks to the use of people (who) go to real shops in sentence 1 and customers in real shops in sentence 2.

You could probably also use a synonym for real in sentence 2, but I can't think of one. Can you?
