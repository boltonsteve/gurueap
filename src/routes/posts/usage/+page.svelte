    <h1><i>Use</i> or <i>Usage</i></h1>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">The <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">usage</span> of technology is very important to learn effectively.</p>

    <p>OK this is a tricky one. I've searched online for an answer but could find only one that is useful for IELTS candidates and EAP students. I'm going to borrow heavily from this person's post. Unfortunately I cannot include an attribution because the link added to the post is no longer active.</p>

    <p>When we refer to <i>word usage</i>, we mean the <i>conventions</i> for using words:</p>
    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">This text describes the principles of word <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">usage</span>.</p>

    <p>By 'conventional' use, we mean:</p>

    <ul class="lh-15">
        <li>how a word is conventionally used in a certain communicative context</li>
        <li>how a word is conventionally used next to other words in a sentence</li>
        <li>how the same word is conventionally used in a particular language<br>(The Indonesian meaning of 'convenient' is not quite the same as the English meaning.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When we refer to <i>use of words</i>, we mean only the employment of words:</p>
    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">He is noted for his frequent <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">use</span> of wrong words.</p>

    <p>People frequently use <i><b>usage</b></i> when they should use <i><b>use</b></i>. The noun <i><b>usage</b></i> should <span class="uli">not</span> be substituted for <i><b>use</b></i> when the meaning is 'the employment of' – even if you think it sounds more sophisticated.</p>

    <p>Neither of the following is correct:</p>

    <ul class="lh-15 lst-none font-italic">
        <li>The wise <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">usage</span> of computers saved the company money.</li>
        <li><span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">Usage</span> of insulation can save fuel.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In both of the previous two examples, <i><b>use</b></i> is the appropriate word.</p>

    <p>Returning to our opening example, we need:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">The <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">use</span> of technology is very important to learn effectively.</p>

    <p>Even better, avoid <i><b>use</b></i> altogether and begin with a more coherent theme:</p>

    <ul class="lst-none lh-15 font-italic">
        <li>Technology plays an important role in effective learning.</li>
        <li>Learning is more effective with the help of technology.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Incidentally people also write <i><b>utilisation</b></i> when they mean <i><b>use</b></i>. That's another one likely to get you into trouble, so just avoid it. <i><b>Use is all you need!</b></i></p>
