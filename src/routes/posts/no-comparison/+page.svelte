    <h1>No comparison</h1>

    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic">Most Asians these days have <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">less difficulty</span> in intercultural communication.</div>

    <WithIcon icon="flag">
        <div slot="html">If your reader speaks Indonesian he will understand that you're translating <b><i>kurang</i></b>.</div>
    </WithIcon>
 
    <p class="mt-0">Non-Indonesian readers will begin to ask themselves:</p>

    <ul class="lh-15">
        <li>What is he comparing?!</li>
        <li>Is he comparing Asians with some other group of people?</li>
        <li class="lst-none">Which people?</li>
        <li>Is he comparing difficulty in intercultural communication with some other kind of difficulty?</li>
        <li class="lst-none">Which kind?</li>
        <li>Is he comparing Asians and intercutural communication today with Asians and intercultural communication in the past?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you're an Indonesian translating <b><i>kurang</i></b> then you're probably not comparing anything. You're simply saying:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">Some Asians find intercultural communication easy.</div>

    <p>As a general rule, when you use comparative adjectives, include the things that you're comparing in the same sentence.</p>

    <WithIcon icon="warning" msg="If you're not comparing more than one thing, then don't use a comparative adjective." />

    <p>The following examples each compare more than one thing.</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">
        <p class="mt-0">Most <b><i>Asians</i></b> these days have less difficulty in intercultural communication than <b><i>Europeans</i></b>.</p>
        <p>Most Asians these days have less difficulty in <b><i>intercultural communication</i></b> than in <b><i>family communication</i></b>.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">Most <b><i>Asians these days</i></b> have less difficulty in intercultural communication than <b><i>Asians</i></b> did <b><i>in the past</i></b>.</p>
    </div>
