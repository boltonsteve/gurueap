    <p>There are several uses of the word <b><i>government</i></b>:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b><i>Government</i></b> (without 'the', without 's')</li>
    <li><b><i>Governments</i></b> (with 's')</li>
    <li><b><i>The government</i></b> (with 'the', without 's')</li>
</ul>

<h3>1. Government (without 'the', without 's')</h3>

<p>Here you are talking about the abstract concept of government. This is the social system in which an elected minority govern the majority:</p>

<div class="alert alert-success font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Government</span> is a potentially effective tool to tackle the problem of unemployment.</div>

<h3>2. Governments (without 'the', with 's')</h3>

<p>Here you are talking about all governments, in all countries, everywhere:</p>

<div class="alert alert-success font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Governments</span> must work hard to tackle the problem of inflation if they want to be competitive in the global market.</div>

<h3>3. The government (with 'the', without 's')</h3>

<p>Here you are usually talking about your own government, although you may be talking about a different but specific government that you have already mentioned elsewhere in your text:</p>

<div class="alert alert-success font-italic"><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">The government</span> must work hard to tackle the problem of inflation in Indonesia.</div>

        <div slot="html">Next time you want to translate <b><i>pemerintah</i></b>, consider which of these three meanings you want to communicate. If you choose the right one, your meaning will be clear and you will receive a high score for vocabulary (LR) and a high score for coherence and cohesion (CC) because it will be easier to understand what you are saying or writing.</div>
