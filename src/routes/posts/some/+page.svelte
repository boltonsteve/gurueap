    <h1>Some</h1>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">Unemployment has increased in recent years for <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">some</span> reasons.</p>

    <p>{@html flagIndo} In this post,Â Indonesian students of English will discover more appropriate ways to say 'beberapa' or berbagai' in IELTS and in general academic writing.</p>

    <h3>For some reason</h3>
    
    <p>First of all <b><i>for some reasons</i></b> appears odd because there is a very similar phrase - <b><i>for some reason</i></b> (reason without 's') - meaning that there <i>may</i> be a reason but the reason is presently unknown. Clearly this is not what the writer intended in the opening example!</p>

    <h3>For several reasons</h3>

    <p>Secondly, there is a slightly different phrase that is often used in this situation - <b><i>for several reasons</i></b> - meaning that there are several possible reasons. Surely this is what the writer meant to communicate? The reasons are known and the writer is going to share them with us.</p>
    
    <h3>Alternatives to <i>some</i></h3>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">The workforce at DJ Computers has become smaller in recent years, <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">for several reasons</span>. First of all, the company has been forced to make staff redundant following financial recession. <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Certain</span> staff will not lose their jobs because their work is essential to the company. <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Various</span> other staff, however, are less essential, and management will consider <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">a number of</span> different criteria when deciding who will stay and who will go.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b><i>several</i></b> (collocates strongly with 'reasons', extremely common inside the lexical phrase 'for several reasons' - examples)</li>
        <li><b><i>certain</i></b> (for people or things that are somehow 'unique' - examples)</li>
        <li><b><i>various</i></b> (collocates strongly with 'other' + plural count noun - examples)</li>
        <li><b><i>a number of</i></b> (plus plural count noun - examples)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Use these alternatives flexibly in your IELTS writing and you will improve your score for LR (Lexical Resource) and possibly also for TA/TR (Task Achievement/Task Response). If you're not sure what is meant by LR, TA and TR, take a look at the <a href="https://www.ialf.edu/eapsteve/descriptors.php" target="blank">IELTS public band descriptors for Speaking and Writing</a>.</p>

    <p class="mb-3">By the way you might also notice that <b><i>staff</i></b> is used here as an uncountable noun, which it is - most of the time. I talk about <b><i>staff</i></b> in more detail in <a href="/posts/staff">a separate post</a>.</p>
