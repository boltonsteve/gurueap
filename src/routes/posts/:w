    let x = `<p>In modern society, in order to improve the quality of their lives, people <ScaffoldSpan done={finished} ori='buy a range of items that allow them to live more comfortably' sc='[What do they do?]' />. Some people claim that as a result, we have moved too far away from <span class="text-primary">established beliefs and conduct</span>, and that this is <span class="text-primary">regrettable</span>. However, I believe that we should <span class="text-primary">take full advantage of the money we earn to enrich our lifestyles</span>, and that we should <span class="text-primary">progress rather than being stuck in outdated traditions</span>, so there is no cause for regret.</p>

        <p>It is claimed that consumerism has done harm to our society because <span class="text-primary">the morals upheld by previous generations have been steadily eroded as we have become too focused on our own comfort</span>. People who hold this opinion contend that <span class="text-primary">values such as respect for the institution of the family have declined in importance</span>, and that this is <span class="text-primary">a shame</span>. However, it is important to remember that <span class="text-primary">many of these so-called values disadvantaged substantial numbers of people</span>. For example, it used to be believed that women should <span class="text-primary">stay at home</span>, <span class="text-primary">clean the house</span> and <span class="text-primary">bring up children</span>. Now, thanks to labour-saving devices bought using salaries of hard-working men and women, families have <span class="text-primary">more time together</span>, and surely nobody misses <span class="text-primary">the unfair old societal norms</span>. </p>

        <p>It is further claimed by some that traditional rituals such as those related to family or social events have become overshadowed by <span class="text-primary">people's desire to acquire new possessions</span> and that this is <span class="text-primary">regrettable</span>. However, such customs continue to thrive in <span class="text-primary">so-called consumerist societies</span>. Wedding rituals, for example, have remained unchanged, and of course newly-weds now receive more <span class="text-primary">gifts</span> than they did in the past â€“ all bought by the proceeds of people's work. Other customs are enhanced by consumer goods such as <span class="text-primary">video cameras</span> and <span class="text-primary">mobile phones</span> as more people can enjoy traditional events either remotely or after the event. Therefore, <span class="text-primary">nothing is lost and there is no need for regret</span>. </p>

        <p>In conclusion, <span class="text-primary">traditions</span> have not been swept away by the desire of people to buy things that improve their lives. It is true that some <span class="text-primary">less-desirable societal norms and habits</span> have gone, but their passing is nothing to lament over.</p>`;
