<div class="mb-3 mw-600">
    <h1>Cannot 'also can'!</h1>
    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">In addition to smoking, excessive drinking <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">also can</span> cause illness.</p>

    <p>This looks like a direct translation from Bahasa Indonesia!</p>

    <p>Actually the meaning is clear, it's just not good collocation. Don't write <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">also can</span>, write <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">can also</span> instead:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">In addition to smoking, excessive drinking <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">can also</span> cause illness.</p>

</div>
