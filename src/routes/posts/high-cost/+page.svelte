    <p class="mt-0">In English if you say something <b><i>needs high cost</i></b> then you are saying:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>It is better if this thing is expensive!</li>
        <li>You <i>want</i> it to be expensive, perhaps because you want to impress people.</li>
        <li>If it is not expensive you're not interested!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is like a king who is building a palace that is bigger and better than all of the other palaces owned by all of the other kings.</p>
    
    <hr>

    <p>If you are desperate to use <b><i>high cost</i></b> then use it as part of a longer noun phrase:</p>

    <ul class="font-italic">
        <li>the high cost of living</li>
        <li>high cost housing</li>
        <li>cheap clothingâ€™s high cost</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The preposition phrase <b><i>of blah blah</i></b> is probably the most common and gives the strongest <a href="http://gurueap.com/posts/collocation" target="_blank">collocation</a>:</p>

    <p>For example, if you are writing about <b><i>the high cost of studying abroad</i></b> then you might say:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">The <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">high cost</span> of studying abroad needs to be taken into consideration. It can be expensive!</div>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
