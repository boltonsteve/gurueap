    <h1>Ask (for)</h1>

    <p>This is a common mistake made by Indonesians translating 'tanya' instead of 'minta'.</p>

    <p>The options in English are (take a deep breath!):</p>

<ol>
	<li><i>I'll <b>ask</b> the waiter.</i> (ask someone)</li>
	<li><i>I'll <b>ask</b> the waiter to bring us the menu.</i> (ask someone to do something)</li>
	<li><i>I'll <b>ask</b> the waiter about the menu.</i> (ask someone about something/someone)</li>
	<li><i>I'll <b>ask</b> the waiter <b>for</b> the menu.</i> (ask someone for something)</li>
	<li><i>I'll <b>ask for</b> the menu.</i> (ask for something/someone)</li>
</ol>

<p>Most native speakers would probably use Number 5.</p>

<p>Notice that <i><b>ask something</b></i> is not in this list. The picture below shows what might happen if you ask the menu!</p>

<p>Possibly there are different ways to translate the correct forms into Indonesian. I know that I'm never confident when using <i><b>tanya</b></i> and <b><i>minta</i></b> in Indonesian. If you have any suggestions, please share in the comments box below!</p>
