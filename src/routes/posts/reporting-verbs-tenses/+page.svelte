    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic">Chomsky (2023) <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">argued</span> that grammar monopoly is an effective way to highlight first language interference.</div>

    <p>I know, I know. 2023 is past and finished, so you want to use past simple tense. However, in this case the <b><i>currency</i></b> of the idea – is it recent and/or valid? – is more important than when it was written.</p>

    <p>The <b><i>currency</i></b> of an idea can occasionally be difficult to determine, but in most cases it is obvious. If we assume that Chomsky is still alive (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/noam_chomsky" target="_blank">as he is at the time of this writing</a>) and that his idea is still current then we use <i>present simple tense</i>, <span class="uli">even if the idea was written in the finished past</span>:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">Chomsky (2023) <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">argues</span> that Grammar Monopoly is an effective way to highlight first language interference.</div>

    <p>In most postgraduate writing we are dealing with <b><i>current</i></b> ideas, from <b><i>recent</i></b> sources, and so most of the time you will need <i>present tense</i> for your reporting verbs.</p>
