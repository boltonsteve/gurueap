    <h1><b><i>Could</i></b> <span class="uli">or</span> <b><i>Was able to?</i></b></h1>
    
    <div class="alert alert-danger font-italic">Budi tried to teach himself IELTS but made no progress. Then he discovered GuruEAP and last Saturday he <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">could</span> achieve band 7.0.</div>

    <p>Ok, I made this one up. It may look like self-promotion, but it’s a problem I often see in student writing.</p>

    <p>Consider this scenario:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">When Steve first arrived in Indonesia he <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">could</span> speak only English and French. Now, after 30 years in Indonesia, he can speak Indonesian fluently. Last weekend he bought some bananas from the local market and he <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">was able to</span> negotiate a reasonable price.</div>

    <p>Here there are two kinds of ability:</p>

    <ol>
        <li class="mb-2">A permanent ability that existed/exists <span class="uli">continuously</span> over time ("..he <b><i>could</i></b> speak../..he <b><i>can</i></b> speak.."). Note that this can be past or present.</li>
        <li>A temporary ability in the past that existed <span class="uli">momentarily</span>, relating to a particular event ("..he <b><i>was able to</i></b> negotiate.."). Note that this is <span class="uli">always past</span>.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>So if we return to the original problem:</p>

    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">Budi tried to teach himself IELTS but made no progress. Then he discovered GuruEAP and last Saturday <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">he was able</span> to achieve band 7.0.</div>

    <WithIcon icon="warning" position="right">
        <div slot="html">Note that the temporary ability was required in a situation that was difficult and required effort or even struggle.</div>
    </WithIcon>

    <p class="mt-0">Here are some similar examples:</p>
    
    <div class="alert alert-success font-italic">
        <p class="mt-0">After a struggle, she <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">was able to</span> upright herself and swim to shore.</p>
        <p>All of the other workers left the project, but I <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">was able to</span> complete it by myself.</p>
        <p>Despite the pandemic, the business <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">was able to</span> continue operating.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, nobody <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">was able to</span> help.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When she saw Tom with another woman, Kelly <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">was unable to</span> hide her disappointment.</p>
    </div>
