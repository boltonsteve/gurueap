<div class="mb-3 mw-600">
    <h1><i>Could</i> or <i>Can</i></h1>
    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">This <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">could</span> be achieved using gravity to allow the water to flow from the higher to the lower level.</p>

    <p>This is possible in some languages but not in English. In English if something happens the same way, all the time, predictably, without variation, then there isn't really any question of probability ('could'). For regular, predictable phenomena use present simple tense <span class="uli">without</span> modals:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">This <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">is achieved</span> using gravity to allow the water to flow from the higher to the lower level.</p>

    <p>Only use modals for <i>unpredictable</i> or <i>uncertain</i> situations, and then think about the degree of predictability or certainty:</p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">In most situations this <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">can</span> be achieved using gravity to allow the water to flow from the higher to the lower level.<br><span class="small">(Gravity usually the best method)</span></p>

    <p class="ml-3 font-italic">This <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">could</span> be achieved using gravity to allow the water to flow from the higher to the lower level, but there are other, better methods.<br><span class="small">(Gravity perhaps <span class="uli">not</span> the best method)</span></p>

    <p>Notice that <b><i>could</i></b> implies a more negative evaluation than <b><i>can</i></b>. Indonesians should think carefully about this distinction as they tend to over-use <b><i>could</i></b>, having been taught in school that <b><i>could</i></b> is more formal than <b><i>can</i></b>. Well, yes it is, but <span class="uli">only in offers and requests</span>:</p>

<ul class="font-italic lh-15">
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Can</span> you pass the salt? (informal)</li>
    <li><span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Could</span> you pass the salt, please? (formal)</li>
    <li>Excuse me. <span class="font-weight-bold text-success">Would</span> you mind passing the salt? (very formal)</li>
</ul>
