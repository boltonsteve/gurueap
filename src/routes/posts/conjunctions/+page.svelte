    <h1>Conjunction Sandwich</h1>

    <p>This video aims to show 2 things:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">That 2 independent clauses in the same sentence MUST be joined using a conjunction.</li>
        <li>That conjunctions can increase the complexity of your sentences, which is something you need to demonstrate in IELTS Speaking and Writing.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Enjoy!</p>
