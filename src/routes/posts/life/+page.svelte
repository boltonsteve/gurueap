    <h1>People's lives</h1>

    <p class="font-italic ml-3">Technology is very useful <span class="font-weight-bold text-danger">for people's life</span>.</p>

    <p>{@html flagIndo} Here the influence of Bahasa Indonesia, and of Indonesian culture, is strong.</p>

<h3>1. People</h3>

<p>Your reader always assumes that you're making statements about people, and not animals or aliens, <span class="uli">unless otherwise stated</span>:</p>

<ul>
    <li class="font-italic">Chocolate is delicious.</li>
    <li class="small mb-1 lst-none">(chocolate eaten <b><i>by people</i></b>!)</li>
    <li class="font-italic">Driving too fast is dangerous.</li>
    <li class="small mb-1 lst-none">(dangerous <b><i>for people</i></b>!)</li>
    <li class="font-italic">Urbanisation causes many problems.</li>
    <li class="small mb-1 lst-none">(problems <b><i>for people</i></b>!)</li>
</ul>

<p>OK, so you might argue that urbanisation also causes problems for wildlife. However, if you don't mention wildlife then we assume you're talking about people.</p>

<h3>2. People's lives</h3>

In our opening example there is a grammatical error -Â <span class="font-weight-bold font-italic text-danger">people's life</span>. <b><i>People</i></b> is plural and <b><i>life</i></b> is singular - so it doesn't make sense to put those words together!

<ul>
    <li class="font-italic">Chocolate is delicious.</li>
    <li class="small mb-1 lst-none">(at any stage of life, as long as you're alive and not dead!)</li>
    <li class="font-italic">Driving too fast is dangerous.</li>
    <li class="small mb-1 lst-none">(at any stage of life, as long as you're alive and not dead!)</li>
    <li class="font-italic">Urbanisation causes many problems.</li>
    <li class="small mb-1 lst-none">(at any stage of life, as long as you're alive and not dead!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, unless you state otherwise, it is always assumed you are talking about people and the things that they do while they are alive, and that these things affect their lives in some way.</p>

<h3>3. When people and their lives <b><i>DO</i></b> matter</h3>

<p class="font-italic ml-3">Chocolate is delicious unless you're dead.</p>
<p>I don't know why anyone would want to write this, but if you're not alive then obviously you cannot enjoy chocolate!</p>
<p class="font-italic ml-3">Driving too fast is dangerous for animals living in forests that have roads passing through them.</p>
<p>It's a problem for animals, not people.</p>
<p class="font-italic ml-3">Urbanisation causes many problems for aliens trying to land their spaceships.</p>
<p>Again, I cannot imagine anybody needing to write this, but these are problems for aliens, not people.</p>

<h3>4. Similar problem words</h3>

<p>Students experience a similar problem with the word <b><i>human(s)</i></b>. Again, you only need to mention humans if you're contrasting them with other species or with aliens!</p>
