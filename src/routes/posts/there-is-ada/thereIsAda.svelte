<h1>There is Ada</h1>
<p class="ml-3 font-italic">In Australia <span class="text-danger font-weight-bold">there are</span> many women receive the same salary as men.</p>
<p>A common mistake made by Indonesian native speakers is to include the 'introductory subject' <b><i>there is/there are</i></b> as well as another subject - next to each other before the verb in a sentence.</p>
<p>This is ok in Bahasa Indonesia, but in English you must choose <b><i>either</i></b> this:</p>
<p class="ml-3"><span class="font-italic">In Australia <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">many women</span> receive the same salary as men.</span><br>(subject: many women)</p>
<p>..<b><i>or</i></b> this:</p>
<p class="ml-3"><span class="font-italic">In Australia <span class="text-success font-weight-bold">there are</span> many women.</span><br>(subject: there are)</p>
<p>Next time your head is telling you <b><i>ada..</i></b>, stop and ask yourself whether you really need to use <b><i>there is/there are</i></b>.</p>
<p>If you already have a subject, do not use <b><i>there is/there are</i></b>!</p>
