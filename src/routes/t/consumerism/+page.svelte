    let incoming = `In modern society, in order to improve the quality of their lives, people [buy a range of items that allow them to live more comfortably|What do they do?]. Some people claim that as a result, we have moved too far away from [established beliefs and conduct|Moved away from what?], and that this is [regrettable|(adjective)]. However, I believe that we should [take full advantage of the money we earn to enrich our lifestyles|What should we do?], and that we should [progress rather than being stuck in outdated traditions|What else should we do?], so there is no cause for regret.

It is claimed that consumerism has done harm to our society because [the morals upheld by previous generations have been steadily eroded as we have become too focused on our own comfort|Why?]. People who hold this opinion contend that [values such as respect for the institution of the family have declined in importance|What have they contended?], and that this is [a shame|What?]. However, it is important to remember that [many of these so-called values disadvantaged substantial numbers of people|Remember that what?]. For example, it used to be believed that women should [stay at home|Should do what?], [clean the house|Do what else?] and [bring up children|And do what else?]. Now, thanks to labour-saving devices bought using salaries of hard-working men and women, families have [more time together|What do people have now?], and surely nobody misses [the unfair old societal norms|What does nobody miss?].

It is further claimed by some that traditional rituals such as those related to family or social events have become overshadowed by [people's desire to acquire new possessions|By what?] and that this is [regrettable|(adjective)]. However, such customs continue to thrive in [so-called consumerist societies|Where?]. Wedding rituals, for example, have remained unchanged, and of course newly-weds now receive more [gifts|More what?] than they did in the past â€“ all bought by the proceeds of people's work. Other customs are enhanced by consumer goods such as [video cameras|Such as what?] and [mobile phones|And what else?] as more people can enjoy traditional events either remotely or after the event. Therefore, [nothing is lost and there is no need for regret|Therefore what?].

In conclusion, [traditions|What?] have not been swept away by the desire of people to buy things that improve their lives. It is true that some [less-desirable societal norms and habits|Some what?] have gone, but their passing is nothing to lament over.`;
