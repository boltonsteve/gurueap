        text: "<p>Proving that a position is false, or at least untenable, by showing that if true it would lead to absurd consequences. This is sometimes called a <b><i>reductio ad absurdum</i></b>. It is a common and highly effective method of refuting (see <span class=\"target\">refutation</span>) a position.</p><p>For example, if someone asserts (see <span class=\"target\">assertion</span>) that anyone who takes a mind-altering drug is a danger to society and should be locked away, then it is easy to refute them by using an absurd consequences move. Alcohol is a mind-altering drug that many of the greatest contributors to western civilisation have used on occasion. Are we then to lock away everyone who has ever used alcohol? Clearly that would be absurd. So, we can be confident that the generalisation which led to the conclusion that we should do so is untenable. It at least has to be refined so that it is clear precisely which mind-altering drugs are supposed to be covered by the term (but see <span class=\"target\">ad hoc clauses</span>).</p><p>Consider another example. A politician might argue that a good way of increasing the income to the treasury would be to investigate every taxpayer's tax returns thoroughly, thereby clamping down on tax evasion. However, in practice this would cost far more to carry out than could possibly be reclaimed and so can be seen to lead to the absurd consequence that a scheme for increasing income would end up by reducing it. This gives us good grounds for jettisoning the politician's suggestion as matters now stand (assuming, of course, that the sole reason for implementing such a policy was to increase treasury income). If a cheaper way of investigating tax returns could be developed then the politician's suggestion might not lead to absurd consequences and could be a viable policy.</p><p>One problem with using the absurd consequences move is that there is usually no touchstone for absurdity; one person's absurdity is another's common sense. Unless a view implies a <span class=\"target\">contradiction</span> there is no easy way of demonstrating its absurdity (see <span class=\"target\">biting the bullet</span>). Nevertheless, if you can see that obviously absurd consequences follow from a position, it gives you good grounds for rejecting it.</p>"

If your hypothesis is threatened by some inconvenient fact which it is incapable of explaining, you have two options: you can either abandon your hypothesis and seek a new one which <i>is</i> capable of explaining this new fact; or else you can add a special clause to your general hypothesis, an <i>ad hoc</i> clause. Patching up a hypothesis is a move which can be acceptable, but often is not.</p><p>This is most clearly seen by considering examples.</p><p>A politician might claim that if the rich are encouraged to grow richer then the poorest of the nation will benefit because the wealth that the rich generate will gradually trickle down to the poor. For the sake of argument, suppose (see <span class=\"target\">supposition</span>) that a five-year study showed that no such trickle-down effect occurred. The politician might then be expected to abandon the initial hypothesis. However, another option would be to add a special clause to the hypothesis to prevent the evidence presented by the study standing as a <span class=\"target\">refutation</span> of it. For instance, the new hypothesis could be, 'If the rich are encouraged to grow richer then the poorest of the nation will benefit because the wealth that the rich generate will gradually trickle down to the poor, <i>but the effects of this will not be visible in the first five years</i>.' If the country in question was just coming out of a recession, a different <i>ad hoc</i> clause could be appended: <i>'but the effects of encouraging the rich to become richer will be masked by the effects of a recession.'</i></p><p>A biologist might begin with the hypothesis that all independent living organisms are either unicellular (consist of a single cell) or multicellular (have many cells).

The existence of slime mould confounds the hypothesis. In the light of this, the biologist might modify the initial hypothesis to, 'All independent living organisms <i>except slime mould</i> are either unicellular or multicellular.' This would be an acceptable modification; however, if there were a large number of species which, like slime mould, defied the simple dichotomy in the hypothesis then adding further <i>ad hoc</i> clauses would at a certain point undermine the power of the generalisation.</p><p>There is a fine line between making a hypothesis more detailed in the light of further evidence and undermining its power as a generalisation by adding numerous exception clauses.</p>"

However, this fact is entirely irrelevant (see <span class=\"target\">irrelevance</span>) to the scientist's ability to assess the evidence. If the scientist had been shown to be a liar, or an incompetent researcher, then that would be relevant to our understanding of the results of the research. But to focus on the scientist's level of fitness is an example of an <i>ad hominem</i> move in the first sense. This should not be confused with the charge of <span class=\"target\">hypocrisy</span>, not practising what you preach. The sedentary scientist would only be a hypocrite if he or she urged others to take up jogging.</p><p>An <i>ad hominem</i> argument in the second sense is a legitimate demonstration of an opponent's <span class=\"target\">inconsistency</span>. This is a much rarer use of the term. An argument is <i>ad hominem</i> in this second sense if it involves turning the argument back on the opponent (sometimes known as the 'you too', or '<i>tu quoque</i>', move). For instance, if someone argues both that all killing is morally wrong and that there is nothing immoral about capital punishment, then (provided that you can demonstrate that capital punishment is a form of killing-not a difficult task), you can use an <i>ad hominem</i> argument (in the second sense) in response. It is impossible without contradicting yourself (see <span class=\"target\">contradiction</span>) to claim that all forms of killing are morally wrong and that one form of killing is not morally wrong. That is tantamount to saying both that all killing is morally wrong <i>and</i> that it is not true that all killing is morally wrong. In this case turning the argument back on the opponent would clearly demonstrate that his or her position was untenable.</p><p>It is important to distinguish the two senses of <i>ad hominem</i> because the first is an <span class=\"target\">informal fallacy</span>; the second a perfectly acceptable move in argument.</p>"

People who have AIDS are prone to colds and often suffer from night sweats.

That is only one possible explanation; it in no way follows logically from the premise 'If you have AIDS then you will be prone to colds and may suffer from night sweats' that anyone who has these symptoms must have AIDS. To arrive at that conclusion you would need to believe that only people who have AIDS are prone to colds and nights sweats; and that is obviously untrue.</p><p>A more exaggerated example makes it clear that this form of argument is not a reliable one. It is undoubtedly true that if I had bought a new car then I would be massively overdrawn at the bank. As it happens, I <i>am</i> massively overdrawn; but there are numerous alternative explanations for this phenomenon, such as that my publisher isn't paying me high enough royalties to support my extravagant lifestyle. I couldn't reliably conclude from the fact that I am overdrawn that must have bought a car. That would clearly be absurd. This technique of considering an obviously absurd argument of the same form in order to show the invalidity of a type of argument is a useful one; it helps separate the possible distraction of the particular content of an argument from the underlying structure. If the argument is an invalid one, even if it happens to yield a true conclusion, then we should not rely on it since the conclusion is not one that follows logically from the premises (see <span class=\"target\">bad reasons fallacy</span>).</p><p>One reason why fallacy of affirming the consequent can be tempting is that it superficially resembles a valid form of argument known as <span class=\"target\">affirming the antecedent</span> (<i>modus ponens</i>):</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>If p then q</div><div>p</div><div>therefore q</div></div><p>An argument with this form is:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>If you burp your baby after feeding she'll sleep soundly.</div><div>You have burped your baby after feeding.</div><div>So she'll sleep soundly.</div></div><p>Here if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

This is especially tempting when the particular explanation is the one which we would most like to be true. However, this is <span class=\"target\">wishful thinking</span> and ignores the possibility of plausible alternative explanations of precisely the same observations.</p><p>The <span class=\"target\">formal fallacy</span> of <span class=\"target\">affirming the consequent</span> typically involves ignoring alternative explanations, as for instance in the following example:</p> <div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>If you accidentally expose your film, then your photographs won't come out.</div><div>Your photographs haven't come out.</div><div>So you must have accidentally exposed your film.</div></div><p>Here the numerous alternative explanations for the photographs' not coming out have been completely ignored: you could have had faulty film, they could have been inexpertly developed, or perhaps you forgot to remove the lens cap.</p><p>When people are arguing from the existence of a correlation to a conclusion about a causal connection (see <span class=\"target\">correlation=cause confusion</span> ) they are particularly prone to neglect the possibility of alternative explanations. For instance, a scientist attempting to show that musical ability is largely inherited might examine the musical ability of a large number of children of talented musicians and compare this with the ability of children from non-musical families. It would not be surprising in such a survey to discover a significant correlation between being a proficient musician and one or both of your parents being musical themselves. However, if the scientist were to take this as firm evidence of <i>inherited</i> musical ability this would be an unreliable conclusion to draw from this evidence alone, since children of musicians are far more likely to be taught to play a musical instrument from an early age than are other children. In other words, the scientist would be ignoring an alternative explanation of the same phenomenon. In fact, probably the most plausible explanation is that there are both hereditary and environmental factors in musical ability; this too is consistent with the observed facts in the imaginary case above.</p><p>People who believe that aliens from another galaxy regularly visit the earth, occasionally abduct people in order to perform medical experiments on them, buzz unsuspecting airline pilots and so on, usually maintain their exotic beliefs by ignoring the alternative explanations of the phenomena they take to be evidence for their beliefs. So, for instance, although it is undoubtedly true that strange patterns are sometimes found in cornfields, it doesn't follow that they must have been made by extraterrestrials. There is a wide range of far more plausible alternative explanations of the phenomenon, such as that they have been made by pranksters, or are the result of freak weather conditions. It is a huge and unwarranted step to move from the fact that such crop circles <i>could</i> have been caused by extraterrestials to the conclusion that they <i>must</i> have been. Before reaching that conclusion you would have to prove that visits by extraterrestials are the only possible explanation, or at least the most plausible one, for crop circles.

        title: "ambiguity",
        text: "<p>An ambiguous word or phrase has two or more meanings. Ambiguity should not be confused with <span class=\"target\">vagueness</span>. Vagueness results from imprecision in language; ambiguity only arises when a word or phrase can be interpreted in different ways. There are three common sorts of ambiguity: <i>lexical</i>, <i>referential</i> and <i>syntactical</i>.</p><p><i>Lexical ambiguity</i> occurs when a word with two or more possible meanings is used so that the phrase or sentence in which it appears can be understood in more than one way. For instance, a book called <i>The Myth of the Goddess</i> could either be about a particular myth or else be an attack on the idea that there ever was a goddess; this is because the word 'myth' has two related yet distinct meanings. Or, similarly, from the title <i>Discrimination</i> alone it would be impossible to tell whether a book was about the unfair treatment of certain groups in society, as in the phrase 'racial discrimination', or the ability to make subtle aesthetic judgements, as in 'the connoisseur exercised fine discrimination'. Of course both these book titles could be deliberate puns. Puns play on lexical ambiguities. When Dr Johnson saw two women standing on their doorsteps arguing he commented that they would never agree because they were 'arguing from different premises', a witticism playing on two possible meanings of 'premises'. Actually, however, two people arguing from different <span class=\"target\">premises</span> (in the sense of starting points in arguments) <i>could</i> reach the same conclusion; but they wouldn't arrive at this conclusion by the same route.</p><p><i>Referential ambiguity</i> occurs when a word is used so that it could be taken to be referring to either of two or more things. For instance, if two people in the room are called John, then just saying 'There's a phone call for John' will be decidedly unhelpful unless it's clear from the context which John you mean (you might, for example, look straight at the appropriate John as you say it). Such ambiguities of reference often occur when using pronouns such as 'it', 'her', 'him' and 'they'. \"The sultana rolled off my plate and came to rest underneath my fork, so I picked it up\" doesn't make absolutely clear what it was that picked up. Was it the sultana, the fork, or possibly, though less likely, the plate? (Although strictly speaking the word 'sultana' could mean 'female sultan', the context within the sentence rules out any <i>lexical ambiguity</i>.)</p><p><i>Syntactical ambiguity</i>, sometimes called <i>amphiboly</i>, occurs when the order of words allows two or more interpretations. For instance, 'a small fish packing factory' could mean either a factory for packing small fish, or else a small factory for packing fish of an undisclosed size. Here judicious use of hyphens would remove the ambiguity; in other cases paraphrasing may be necessary. 'I heard about what you got up to at work yesterday' is ambiguous in two ways. It could either mean that I I heard what you got up to when you were at work, or that I was at work when I heard what you got up to. The second way in which it is ambiguous is that the order of words leaves it unclear as to whether it was yesterday that I heard about you, or whether what I heard about you referred to something that you did yesterday.</p><p>While it is extremely difficult to eliminate all ambiguity, wherever there is a serious possibility of confusion it is worth taking the time to make your intended meaning clear (see also <span class=\"target\">equivocation</span>). However, it would be sheer pedantry to waste your life ruling out all possible but highly unlikely interpretations, unless of course you are drawing up a legal document.</p>"

        text: "<p>Arguments based on a comparison between two things which are alleged to be similar. Arguments from analogy rely on the principle that if two things are similar in some known respects they are likely to be similar in other respects even if these are not directly observable.</p><p>This principle, which relies on <span class=\"target\">induction</span>, at best usually only yields <i>probable</i> conclusions; it rarely provides a conclusive proof since similarity in some respects does not always reliably indicate similarity in other respects. An exception to this is when the similarity in question is similarity of logical form, in which case, if one argument is valid (see <span class=\"target\">validity</span>), then any other argument of the same logical form must also be valid.</p> <p>Arguing on the basis of analogy may at first glance seem an entirely reliable form of reasoning. How else could we learn from our experience if not by transferring the results of particular discoveries to similar new situations? However, arguments from analogy are only reliable if the situations being compared are <i>relevantly</i> similar, and unfortunately there is no simple test for relevant similarity.</p><p>One of the most famous uses of argument from analogy is the attempt to prove God's existence known as the Argument from Design. In its simplest form this is the argument that because there are various visible similarities between natural objects and those which have been designed by human beings -between the human eye and a camera, for instance-we can conclude that both must have been produced by a similar sort of intelligence. In other words, perceivable similarities between two sorts of thing are taken as a reliable indication that they have similar sorts of origin: in this case an intelligent designer. Because the eye is more sophisticated in 'design' than the camera, using this argument from analogy, we can conclude that the designer of the eye was correspondingly more intelligent and powerful than the designer of the camera. The conclusion of the Argument from Design is that the intelligent and powerful designer of the eye must have been God.</p><p>However, as many philosophers have pointed out, the analogy between such things as an eye and a camera is relatively weak; although there are respects in which they are quite similar (both have a lens, for instance), there are also numerous respects in which they differ (the eye, for instance, is part of a living organism; the camera is a machine).</p><p>If the Argument from Design rests on a relatively weak analogy (see <span class=\"target\">disanology</span>), then its conclusions about the causes of the apparent design of natural objects must be correspondingly weak. Besides, in this case there is also a highly plausible <span class=\"target\">alternative explanation</span> of precisely the same observations, namely Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The Argument from Design does not on its own provide anything like a proof of God's existence both because the analogy on which it rests is relatively weak and because there is a competing theory which explains the apparent design of living organisms as arising from the impersonal workings of heredity and environment.</p><p>The philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson, writing on the morality of abortion, used an analogy to defend her view that even if a foetus has rights, these do not necessarily override a woman's right to determine what happens in and to her body (see also <span class=\"target\">thought experiment</span>). She compared some kinds of pregnancy with the imagined situation of waking up to find that you have had a famous violinist plugged into your vital organs and being told that unless you leave him plugged in for nine months, thereby causing you considerable discomfort, he will die. The point of this far-fetched analogy was to bring out in a clear way some of what is at stake in debates about a foetus's right not to be aborted.</p><p>Whilst we would admire someone who chose to keep the violinist plugged in, it does not seem accurate to say that any right he has to life overrides your right to determine what happens to your body. Obviously this is a controversial analogy which is only relevantly similar to <i>some</i> forms of pregnancy (and for most of us, the power of the thought experiment depends on knowing <i>which</i> famous violinist is to be plugged into us). However, Thomson's use of this analogy was very important in bringing out what was implicit in the pro- and anti-abortion arguments and has been the starting-point for most discussion of the topic since she published it in an article in 1971.</p><p>When animal rights activists argue that we should be more concerned about animal welfare their arguments usually rely on an implicit analogy between human and animal abilities to feel pain. We know that humans feel pain and that, in its extreme forms, it is a terrible thing which we would do almost anything to avoid: that's why torture can be so effective. Mammals are very like human beings in many ways. They are genetically quite closely related to us and have similar physiological responses to physical damage; like us they try to avoid damage to themselves, and in certain circumstances make noises which we think we can recognise as indicating that they are in pain because they are similar to noises we make when in pain. So it seems reasonable to conclude on the basis of the analogy between human beings and mammals that mammals are capable of feeling certain sorts of pain. True, there are some differences between humans and other mammals. Apart from a few exceptional chimpanzees, other mammals don't have language, for instance. But these are not usually considered relevant differences. Insects, however, are far less like most human beings than are mammals; so any conclusion about insect pain based on an analogy with human pain would be correspondingly weaker than one about mammal pain.</p> <p>Consider one more example. Some pundits have argued that outlawing possession of guns in the United States would, far from reducing violent crime, actually increase the number of shootings that would occur. Their reasoning is based on the fact that outlawing alcohol during the Prohibition was correlated with a huge increase in illegal alcohol-related crime (but see <span class=\"target\">correlation=cause confusion</span>). Similarly, they say, outlawing gun ownership will lead to an increase in gun trafficking, giving criminals even greater access to firearms than they now have. And the more access criminals have to firearms, the more likely they are to use them. This argument relies on there being relevant similarities between the outlawing of alcohol during Prohibition and the outlawing of guns today. It involves other <span class=\"target\">assumptions</span> too, such as that if criminals possess firearms they are likely to use them, and that widespread possession of firearms doesn't itself act as a deterrent to their use because of the risk of getting shot yourself if you open fire (i.e. your opponent is more likely to be armed). But the main argument rests on an analogy. However, it is fairly easy to see that this is a very weak analogy since the situations differ in so many important respects: the fact that guns don't get consumed when you use them, whereas alcohol does, for instance. If the two situations can be shown to be significantly dissimilar then any conclusions drawn on the basis of such an analogy will require independent support. The conclusion of the argument could turn out to be true (see <span class=\"target\">bad reasons fallacy</span>), but this argument from analogy alone does not provide conclusive support for the conclusion.</p><p>Analogies are often used as a form of <span class=\"target\">rhetoric</span>. When, for example, Hitler claimed that he was going to wring Britain's neck like a chicken, this was meant to show the power of Nazi Germany, and the vulnerability of Britain: Germany's relation to Britain was supposed to be like that of a farmer to a chicken about to be slaughtered. Churchill famously retorted, 'Some chicken, some neck', suggesting that the analogy was weaker in certain relevant respects than Hitler believed, and that Hitler's conclusion about the ease with which he would defeat the British and their Allies was unwarranted. Neither Hitler nor Churchill produced an argument for their conclusions.</p><p>With strong analogies, the arguer may be on safe ground.  However, even where an analogy appears to be very strong, there is still a possibility of being misled. Mushrooms and toadstools can look very similar and are closely related, yet the former are edible and the latter poisonous. So even where there seem to be excellent grounds for drawing conclusions on the basis of two things being very similar in some respect, it may prove unwise to treat these conclusions as firmly established. This is not to say that arguing on the basis of an analogy should be avoided, only that it should be treated with caution and that, wherever possible, independent support for the conclusion should be sought. It would be unreasonable to expect an analogy to hold in <i>every</i> respect, or even in <i>most</i> respects; however, for the argument to have any force, the analogy must hold in <i>relevant</i> respects. What counts as a relevant respect is determined largely by context. As with most applications of critical thinking it is important to be sensitive to the particular case, a fact rarely acknowledged in textbooks on the subject.</p>"

In many cases this is very weak evidence and typically involves generalising from a particular case (see <span class=\"target\">rash generalisation</span>).</p><p>For instance, if you are debating whether or not acupuncture is an adequate alternative to conventional medicine, someone might tell you that their friend tried acupuncture and that it seemed to work wonders. On its own this is merely anecdotal evidence. First, there is a risk that details of the story may get changed in the retelling. More importantly, to argue from this single case that acupuncture is an adequate alternative to conventional medicine would be irresponsible: anecdotal evidence is different from a controlled scientific investigation into the effectiveness of acupuncture. For instance, a scientist investigating this question would want to have a control group to see if people spontaneously recover from ailments without having any treatment at all. A scientist would also consider more than a single case, and follow up the history of individual cases to see if any improvements in health were short-term. And, of course, comparisons would have to be made between the effects of acupuncture and more conventional medical techniques, taking into account placebo effects and the possibility of spontaneous recovery. Anecdotal evidence cannot usually provide this sort of information in a reliable form and may be clouded by <span class=\"target\">wishful thinking</span>.</p><p>The term 'anecdotal evidence' is often used to suggest that the evidence is <i>merely</i> anecdotal, that is, in a pejorative way. However, not all anecdotal evidence is unreliable: if you have reason to be confident in the source of the evidence, then anecdotal evidence can help to support or undermine a conclusion. Indeed, many sorts of scientific enquiry begin by examining anecdotal evidence about the phenomenon to be examined, and on the basis of this develop a way of testing in a controlled way whether or not this evidence points to the truth of the matter. For instance, an investigation into possible cures for night cramps in elderly patients might begin by looking at the anecdotal evidence that quinine in tonic water reduces their occurrence. Detailed examination of patients under controlled conditions might then reveal that the anecdotal evidence had been unreliable, and that the quinine had only a minimal effect on the incidence of cramps.</p><p>The appropriateness of using anecdotal evidence depends entirely on the context and on the type of anecdotal evidence available.</p>"

This should not be confused with the use of 'argument', meaning a quarrel, in which <span class=\"target\">assertion</span> and counter-assertion are far more common than reasoning. In the sense in which 'argument' is used in this book, an argument provides reasons for believing a conclusion. In contrast, an assertion merely presents a conclusion and we have no particular grounds for believing that conclusion, unless of course we know its source to be a reliable authority on the subject of the conclusion (see <span class=\"target\">truth by authority</span>). Reliable authorities are usually capable of giving arguments which support their conclusions.</p><p>In logic textbooks, arguments, especially deductive ones (see <span class=\"target\">deduction</span>), are very neat, with the premises clearly distinguished from the conclusion and the conclusion indicated by the word 'therefore'. In real life the structure of arguments is unlikely to be So easy to identify. Usually at least one of the premises is assumed rather than stated explicitly (see <span class=\"target\">assumptions</span> and <span class=\"target\">enthymeme</span>); conclusions do not always come after the premises, they often come before, and are rarely signposted by words such as 'therefore' and 'so' Consequently it is often necessary to clarify the precise relation between premises and conclusion before attempting to evaluate any argument.</p><p>For instance, you might come across the following:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>You shouldn't let your child watch that film <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>.</div><div>It's so violent.</div></div><p>On further questioning it might emerge that the implied argument was:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"> <div>Watching violent films causes children to be violent.</div><div>You should prevent children from doing anything that makes them violent.</div><div>You can prevent your child watching a film.</div><div><i>A Clockwork Orange</i> is a violent film.</div><div>Therefore you should prevent your child watching the film <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>.</div></div><p>This is a valid argument (see <span class=\"target\">validity</span>). Obviously it would in most contexts be extremely tedious to spell out every condensed argument in this fashion. However, often it is unclear precisely how the premises are supposed to be supporting the conclusion; in such cases it may be worth making the underlying argument explicit.</p><p>Notice that in the above argument, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true: there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true and yet the conclusion false. This is because the structure of the argument is a valid one (see <span class=\"target\">validity</span>). Another way of putting this is that the form of a valid argument is truthpreserving: if you put true premises into this sort of structure, then you are guaranteed to get a true conclusion from it. What's more, if you know the argument to be valid then you must either accept the conclusion as true, or else deny the truth of at least one of the premises. A valid argument with true premises is known as a <span class=\"target\">sound argument</span>.</p><p>Some arguments are inductive (see <span class=\"target\">induction</span>). For instance, consider the following:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>Picture restoration has often damaged important paintings; the world's national galleries all contain examples of damaging restoration. So you should only embark upon a policy of picture restoration with extreme caution since there is a serious risk that otherwise you will cause more damage than you prevent.</div></div><p>This is an argument, but it is not deductive: it is not truth-preserving.</p><p>Its conclusion, that you should only embark upon a policy of picture restoration with extreme caution, is based on the evidence that some picture restorers in the past have caused serious damage to paintings. The reasons given for believing the conclusion are based on observation and on the assumption that the future will be like the past in certain relevant respects. Inductive arguments never prove anything conclusively; however they do point to what is probably or almost certainly true. They can provide very strong support for conclusions even though this always stops short of the truth-preserving nature of deductive arguments.</p><p>Arguments are of greater value than unsupported <span class=\"target\">assertion</span> since they provide reasoning which other people can assess for themselves to see whether or not it supports the given conclusion. Assessing the arguments on either side is one of the best methods we have for deciding between competing views on any issue. If someone presents an argument we can judge whether or not their conclusion is supported by the reasons given; if they resort to <span class=\"target\">prejudice</span>, <span class=\"target\">rhetoric</span>, and unsupported assertion, even though the conclusions may turn out to be true, we aren't in a position to see why they are true or how they have been reached.</p>"

We all make assumptions most of the time; if we didn't, any discussion would require so much stagesetting that we'd never get to the point. Because we share many assumptions it is relatively easy to communicate with one another. But when two people try to discuss an issue on which they hold very different assumptions, confusion and misunderstandings are likely to arise.</p><p>For instance, in a discussion about the status of so-called computer viruses, one eminent scientist argued that there are good reasons for considering computer viruses a form of life since, like ordinary viruses, they are capable of replicating themselves and are parasitic. Another scientist pointed out that even if we concede the point that computer viruses are very like ordinary viruses, this still doesn't prove that computer viruses should be considered living organisms since it is contentious to say that ordinary viruses are alive themselves. The first scientist was arguing on the basis of a strong analogy (see <span class=\"target\">analogy</span>, <span class=\"target\">arguments from</span>) between computer viruses and ordinary viruses and the second scientist was challenging the conclusion which could be drawn even if the analogy actually held. The second scientist's point was that the first scientist was making a large assumption about whether ordinary viruses are alive or not. Only if ordinary viruses were alive would the first scientist's conclusion be warranted. This assumption was not made explicit in the first scientist's argument: he only gave good reasons for there being a strong analogy between computer and ordinary viruses. Once the assumption has been made explicit it can be discussed and its truth or falsity ascertained (see also <span class=\"target\">enthymeme</span>). In this case the question of whether or not a virus is a living thing could be addressed and then, if this is established, the strength of the analogy between biological and computer viruses could be examined.</p><p>Some people joke that when you <i>assume</i> something you 'make an ass out of <i>u</i> and <i>me</i>'. This isn't just a bad pun; it is misleading. We all have to make assumptions most of the time and there is nothing intrinsically wrong with making them provided that the assumptions are actually true and we are aware of what those assumptions are. I suppose the point of the comment is that in certain situations it is very important not to make any assumptions before evidence has been gathered.

That this is an unreliable form of argument quickly becomes clear when you consider particular examples of it.</p><p>For instance, a scientist who after conducting many controlled experiments comes to the <span class=\"target\">conclusion</span> that a limited form of telepathy occurs should not dismiss these findings simply because many people believe in telepathy purely on the basis of <span class=\"target\">wishful thinking</span>.

They would also, incidentally, be guilty of equivocation since it is not at all clear that any of the so-called 'euthanasia' policies carried out by Hitler merited that name at all. They might also be using an implied <span class=\"target\">slippery slope argument</span>, hinting that if you legalise certain sorts of killing this will lead inexorably towards genocide. However, the bad company fallacy employed here suggests that because Hitler approved of something for that very reason it must be morally wrong or based on a false belief. This is not to say that there might not be independent reasons why legalising euthanasia might be a mistake, only that the fact that Hitler put into practice a policy of euthanasia is not in itself a good reason for avoiding doing likewise. What is needed is some kind of analysis of the relevant similarities between the two situations.</p><p>Usually those who employ the bad company fallacy do so as a form of <span class=\"target\">rhetoric</span> so as to persuade you that your position cannot be defended. It is particularly tempting to succumb to this rhetoric because evil and stupid people typically hold many false beliefs; also it can be extremely disconcerting to find yourself agreeing with people whom you thoroughly despise. However, that isn't enough to prove that because Hitler believed something it must therefore have been false: you need further reasons to support the claim that it is false. After all, Hitler believed that 2+3=5 and that Berlin was in Germany. What this form of argument ignores is that evil and stupid people not only hold numerous false beliefs, but also many true ones (see also <span class=\"target\">ad hominem move</span> and <span class=\"target\">getting personal</span>).</p><p>The bad company fallacy is sometimes form of <span class=\"target\">enthymeme</span>, that is, an argument which has an unstated <span class=\"target\">assumption</span> as an important <span class=\"target\">premise</span>. In this example the unstated assumption is 'Anything that Hitler endorsed must have been morally wrong simply because he endorsed it.' Even though Hitler endorsed many evil practices and was responsible for some of the worst known crimes against humanity, it does not follow that <i>everything</i> which he endorsed or believed was morally wrong or false.</p><p>The bad company fallacy can be contrasted with what could be called the good company fallacy: the fallacy of believing whatever someone of whom you approve endorses (see also <span class=\"target\">kowtowing</span>, <span class=\"target\">truth by authority</span> and <span class=\"target\">universal expertise</span>).

It is possible to derive true conclusions from false <span class=\"target\">premises</span>; it is also possible to derive them from true premises but using fallacious reasoning. Even so, it can be tempting to believe that bad arguments or false premises <i>never</i> yield truth. In fact they sometimes do; it is just that they don't <i>reliably</i> do so.</p><p>For instance, consider the following <span class=\"target\">argument</span>:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>All fish lay eggs.</div><div>The duck-billed platypus is a fish.</div><div>Therefore the duck-billed platypus lays eggs.</div></div><p>This is a valid argument (see <span class=\"target\">validity</span>) with two false premises and a true conclusion. Premise one is false because some fish give birth to live young; premise two because the duck-billed platypus is certainly not a fish; the conclusion, however, is true since duck-billed platypuses <i>do</i> lay <i>eggs</i>. So in some cases a true conclusion can emerge despite the premises being false, and this means that you cannot prove a conclusion to be false simply by demonstrating that it has been derived from false premises. What you can do by this method is show that the person who holds a belief on the basis of false premises or of relying on an invalid form of argument hasn't adequately justified their belief. In this respect the situation is similar to one in which someone holds a true belief on the basis of merely <span class=\"target\">anecdotal evidence</span>, evidence which could nevertheless be corroborated by scientific investigation.</p><p>Take a further example, this time of an argument with a true conclusion derived from true premises but by fallacious reasoning:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>Some art galleries don't charge an entrance fee.</div><div>London's National Gallery is an art gallery.</div><div>Therefore London's National Gallery doesn't charge an entry fee.</div></div><p>The premises of this argument are true; and it is true that London's National Gallery doesn't charge an entry fee. Yet this conclusion does not reliably follow from the premises since they leave open the possibility that London's National Gallery might charge an entry fee. In other words the 'therefore' is an example of the <span class=\"target\">spurious 'therefore'</span> (see also <span class=\"target\">non sequitur</span>). All that the first premise tells us is that <i>some</i> art galleries are free; it gives no clues as to whether or not London's National Gallery falls within the class of free galleries. This is a weakness in the way the conclusion has been reached. You would be committing the bad reasons fallacy if you thought that by undermining the way the conclusion was reached you had demonstrated it to be false: true conclusions can be reached accidentally, or asserted without appropriate supporting evidence.</p><p>Two further examples. A poorly conducted piece of sociological research designed to assess the causes of criminal behaviour might, despite being based on an unrepresentative sample and inappropriate statistical tests, turn up some true conclusions. Someone who knows next to nothing about computers might correctly identify that your disk drive is faulty even though the way they arrived at this conclusion involved all kinds of reasoning errors. Poor reasoning in no way guarantees false conclusions. So, in order to refute (see <span class=\"target\">refutation</span>) a conclusion it is not enough simply to show that it has been reached by unreliable means; you need to provide further argument that demonstrates that it is false.</p>"

Often it involves circularity (see <span class=\"target\">circular arguments</span>). This is a valid form of argument (see <span class=\"target\">validity</span>) and not a <span class=\"target\">formal fallacy</span>: if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. However, since begging the question involves assuming the very point that is at issue it is a move which should not convince someone for whom that point is as yet undecided. It is uninformative and irritating rather than logically invalid.</p><p>For example, in a law case, if someone is being tried on an accusation of murder, and has pleaded not guilty, it would be begging the question to refer to them as 'the murderer' rather than 'the accused' until their guilt had been established. This is because the point of the law case is to establish whether or not they are guilty and to call them 'the murderer' would be to assume a position on the very point that is at issue. In a different context using the term would not beg any question.</p <p>The philosopher René Descartes has sometimes, controversially, been accused of begging the question with his famous cogito argument: 'I think therefore I am.' Since this is supposed to show that I exist, to say 'I think' assumes already that I exist and so assumes an answer to the very point that is at issue. All Descartes should have said, according to his critics, was 'there are thoughts now'; but if he had said that, it would have been difficult for him to conclude 'I exist' unless he assumed that all thoughts must have a thinker. However, to be fair to Descartes, he did explicitly deny that 'I exist' was intended to be the conclusion of a <span class=\"target\">deduction</span>. His point was that it was psychologically impossible to doubt the truth of the thought. So, perhaps the criticism that he was begging the question is levelled at a <span class=\"target\">straw man</span>.</p <p>Some forms of begging the question occur in the way questions are asked. <span class=\"target\">Complex questions</span> are often question-begging in this way. For instance, the question 'When did you start beating your husband?' might be question-begging if the fact that you did beat your husband had yet to be established. Or if a relation asks you what you intend to study at university, if it has yet to be established that you intend to go to university then it would be fairer to break the question down into its constituent parts: 'Do you intend to go to university?' and 'If so, what do you intend to study there?' Asking the complex question would otherwise be a case of begging the question.</p><p>This all makes it sound as if question-begging is relatively easy to spot; however, in many cases it is not obvious what is to be established. The first stage in such cases is to eliminate any lack of clarity about what is being discussed and to make explicit the point of the discussion. Only when this has been clarified is it possible to assess the extent to which the question has been begged.</p><p>There is a colloquial use of 'begging the question' with which this should not be confused. Some journalists use the phrase to mean something like *invites the question...' as in, for instance, 'The difficulty of disposing of radioactive waste <i>begs the question</i> \"Is nuclear power really as safe and economical as we've been told?\" or 'The widespread corruption in the public services <i>begs the question</i> \"Why hasn't there been an investigation of such misdemeanours before?\" There is no need ever to use 'begs the question' in this sense as there are numerous unambiguous alternatives such as 'invites the question' or 'suggests the question'.</p>"

The most extreme cases of biting the bullet occur when those with whom you are arguing have no qualms whatsoever about embracing contradictions. Logical arguments are unlikely to have much force with such people.

A consequence of the basic utilitarian principle is that if it could be shown that punishing an innocent person would in some circumstances bring about the most happiness of any possible action (perhaps because a majority of the public believed this person to be guilty and would get pleasure from the knowledge that he was punished), then it would be morally right in those circumstances to punish that innocent person. For most of us this would be an unpalatable consequence of the general utilitarian principle; for many people it would be sufficient to cast doubt on the truth of this simplest version of utilitarianism and might provide the impetus either to revise (see <span class=\"target\">ad ho clauses</span>) or reject utilitarianism altogether. However, a hardline utilitarian might be prepared to bite the bullet and simply say, \"Yes, this is a consequence of my theory and I'm prepared to accept it: in some situations it may be morally right to punish an innocent person.\"</p><p>Or, to take another example: someone might embrace the principle that only people who have never in their lives broken a law should be allowed to become judges. Whilst at first glance this might seem a sensible precaution to take, on reflection it becomes clear that this would in fact rule out almost all of those who are now judges, since the great majority of these will at some time have broken a speeding or parking restriction, or else have broken the law in some other minor way, though they may not have been prosecuted.

One attempt to justify induction is to suggest that we know it is a reliable way of arguing because it has worked well for us in the past: we have all made a large number of successful inductive generalisations before now, SO we can conclude that it is a reliable way of reasoning. However, on closer inspection this turns out to be a circular argument.

Motor racing, cricket, rugby, karate and powerboat racing also sometimes result in horrific injuries, and are thus, in this respect, companions in guilt with boxing. To be consistent the opponent of boxing would need to adopt the same stance towards all these other sports, or else show how they are relevantly different from boxing. Of course, there might be such reasons: one reason often given for singling out boxing is that it is one of very few sports in which actual physical damage to your opponent is one of the principal aims. Using the companions in guilt move may force your opponent to be explicit about what he or she takes to be unique to the topic in question.</p><p>Consider another example, a more literal example of companions in guilt. When Jesus prevented a mob from stoning a woman caught in adultery he used the ploy of suggesting that whoever among them was without sin should cast the first stone. The idea was that if the woman was guilty of sin, then so too was everyone in the crowd. But it is possible that the sins that some of the people about to stone the woman were of a sufficiently different kind (sins of thought, perhaps, rather than of action) to set them apart from the woman, and that they could have made a case for the woman's sins being of a more serious nature than their own (though not, presumably, so serious as to justify the cruel practice of stoning).</p><p>Some uses of the companions in guilt move are dubious.

The use of complex questions is sometimes known as the fallacy of many questions (an <span class=\"target\">informal fallacy</span>). Complex questions usually involve <span class=\"target\">begging the question</span> since they typically assume a position on the very point that is at issue. It is extremely difficult to answer them in a straightforward way without seeming to accept the questioner's <span class=\"target\">assumptions</span>. Such questions are often used deliberately to trick the unwary into some kind of confession or apparent confession.</p><p>For instance, if someone asks you, 'When did you stop taking drugs?' this may be a deliberate ploy to get you to admit by implication that you used to take drugs. If it has yet to be established that you have ever taken drugs, then it would be fairer to ask you three simpler questions which are implicitly contained in this complex question:</p><ol><li>Have you ever taken drugs?</li><li>If so, have you stopped taking them?</li><li>If so, when did you stop taking them?</li></ol><p>Until the answers to the first and second questions have been established, it would in most contexts be question-begging to ask, \"When did you stop taking drugs?\"</p><p>The journalist who asks a famous author, \"When did you decide you wanted to be a novelist?\" may be asking a complex question to save time. But this is clearly question-begging in that it assumes that the author actually did decide at some time to become a novelist, which needn't have been the case at all; the author might never have decided to become a novelist. The journalist's question could be broken down into simpler questions:</p><ol><li>Did you make a decision to become a novelist?</li><li>If so, when?</li></ol><p>In the two examples given above there is a simple way out for the person being questioned: to answer: 'I have never taken drugs' or 'I never made a conscious decision to become a novelist'. But some other forms of complex question can be much harder to answer. For instance, if someone asks, 'Are you going to carry on behaving like a spoilt brat or will you concede that you ought to spend at least half an hour a day doing the housework?' then it is almost impossible to give a brief answer without suggesting either that you have been behaving like a spoilt brat and that you will carry on doing so, or that you are prepared to concede that you ought to spend at least half an hour a day doing the housework. But the questioner may have set up a <span class=\"target\">false dichotomy</span>: there may be further options not given in this complex question. Saying 'I have not behaved and therefore cannot continue to behave like a spoilt brat, nor will I concede that I ought to spend at least half an hour a day doing the housework' seems a very long-winded way of answering such a question, but unless you answer the constituent parts individually, you are likely to find that you have been tricked into an implicit agreement with the questioner's <span class=\"target\">assumptions</span>.</p><p>Complex questions should not be confused with leading questions, although some leading questions are complex questions. Leading questions are questions which suggest the answer which the person being questioned should make.

        text: "<p>The mistake of treating a correlation as conclusive evidence of a direct causal connection. Two sorts of event may be correlated (that is, whenever one is found, the other is usually found) without there being a direct causal connection between them. Just because two things tend to be found together, it doesn't follow that one of them causes the other. Nevertheless many people act as if any correlation provides proof of a direct causal link. But such correlation may result from a common cause of the two events, from mere coincidence, or it may provide just as much evidence for an alternative hypothesis as it does for the one which is alleged to follow from it (see <span class=\"target\">alternative explanations</span>). This isn't to say that correlations are irrelevant to answering questions about causes: far from it, they are the basis of most judgements about causes. However, it is important to recognise the common errors which people make when reasoning about causes.</p><p>It is easy to find examples of correlations which are far more systematic than could occur by chance and yet which it would be absurd to treat as evidence of a direct causal link. For instance, there is a high degree of correlation between shoe size and vocabulary size: people with larger shoe sizes tend to have much larger vocabularies than people with smaller shoe sizes. But having larger feet does not <i>cause</i> anyone to gain a larger vocabulary; nor does having a large vocabulary <i>cause</i> your feet to grow. The obvious explanation of the correlation is that children tend to have much smaller feet than adults, and, because children acquire their vocabularies gradually as they grow older, it is hardly surprising that, on average, people with smaller feet have smaller vocabularies. In other words, foot size and vocabulary size can be explained in terms of features of the process of human development from infancy to adulthood: a cause which both observed phenomena have in common.</p><p>Correlations may stem from coincidence rather than causal links; this is particularly likely when there have been relatively few examples of the correlation on which to base the conclusion. For instance, a superstitious sports fan might notice that every time she wore her lucky ring, her favourite team won; when she forgot to put it on her team lost. Being superstitious, she concluded that somehow wearing the ring <i>caused</i> her team to win, when in fact it was purely coincidental, as she would no doubt have discovered if she had observed the pattern of her team's performance in relation to her ring-wearing over, say, a year. The superstitious sports fan's reasoning is an example of the reasoning error traditionally known as <span class=\"target\">post ho ergo propter hoc</span> (Latin for 'because it occurs after this, therefore it occurs because of this'), a pattern of reasoning to which human beings are especially prone.</p><p>When attempting to understand the causes of various phenomena, discovering a correlation between supposed cause and effect should only be the first stage; in every case a plausible explanation of <i>how</i> the cause brings about that particular effect is needed. A healthy scepticism about causal links alleged on the basis of observed correlation is admirable, though this can be taken too far. For instance, at least one eminent scientist has attacked a very plausible hypothesis about the causal links between smoking and getting lung cancer. His grounds for this attack stem from the sort of consideration discussed above: the possibility of the two correlated phenomena having a common cause rather than one being the cause of the other. Despite the degree of correlation between being a heavy smoker and getting lung cancer in later life, and the convincing medical explanations of how this link occurs, the scientist claimed that the evidence pointed in a different direction. He maintained that people who are genetically prone to getting lung cancer are also far more likely to take up smoking. So it isn't the smoking that causes lung cancer, but the fact that you are the type of person who is both likely to take up smoking and likely to get lung cancer that explains the observed correlation between smoking and lung cancer. It is possible that the scientist was simply playing <span class=\"target\">devil's advocate</span>, to get scientists to sharpen their reasoning about smoking. However, if this wasn't the case, then his alternative hypothesis should be assessed for its explanatory force and predictive ability.</p>"

If an argument can withstand sustained onslaught from someone scrutinizing it for weaknesses then it may well be a good one; if it can't, then it should be patched up (preferably not by adding spurious <span class=\"target\">ad hoc clauses</span>), or at worst, jettisoned.</p><p>The philosopher René Descartes in his <i>Meditations</i> wanted to defend the view that there are some things which we can know for certain. However, rather than simply stating his conclusions, he began his 'First Meditation' by playing devil's advocate against his own ideas, putting forward the best case for extreme scepticism about the information we acquire through our five senses. He pointed out that everything we learn through the senses is open to doubt, not just because the senses can be unreliable, but also because we can't be certain at any particular time that we are not dreaming. He went even one step beyond this, imagining that he was being systematically deceived by a cunning and powerful evil demon (an example of a <span class=\"target\">thought experiment</span>), and questioned whether he could be absolutely certain that this wasn't happening to him. Only after Descartes had built up the best possible case for the idea that we can know nothing for certain did he set out his idea that the very act of doubting proves for certain that the doubter exists. Thus by first examining the best possible arguments against his own position he pre-empted many of the criticisms that septics would otherwise have made against his position and demonstrated the force of his anti-sceptical argument.</p><p>People who play devil's advocate are sometimes accused of <span class=\"target\">hypocrisy</span>, especially when they make criticisms which they do not sincerely endorse: they don't really believe in the arguments they use, or else they know the <span class=\"target\">conclusion</span> of the position they are attacking is true. However, this accusation of hypocrisy misses the point and perhaps in part stems from the negative associations of the word 'devil' in the title at the expense of the connotations of the word 'advocate'. Hypocrites hide their true intentions and beliefs; those who play devil's advocate openly encourage their targets tO give watertight arguments for their conclusions and to take heed of the force of the strongest arguments on the other side. Often the point of using this strategy is to get someone to give good reasons in support of conclusions to which the devil's advocate is favourably disposed, thus encouraging them to investigate the justification for views which might turn out to be mere <span class=\"target\">prejudices</span>, or perhaps true conclusions defended by weak arguments (see <span class=\"target\">bad reasons fallacy</span>).

For example, the age of consent in Britain is fixed at 16 years, though it could have been fixed a few weeks or months earlier or later without making any significant difference. But this doesn't mean we shouldn't draw a line at all; in order to protect children from sexual exploitation it is important to fix an age beneath which sexual intercourse is prohibited by law. Similarly, in Britain the speed limit in built-up areas is 30 miles per hour; it could have been fixed at 25 miles per hour or 35 miles per hour. However, it in no way follows from this that we should ignore the speed limit once the line between speeding and driving safely has been established, nor that the arbitrariness of the precise speed at which the line was drawn means that it could just as well have been fixed at 90 miles per hour.

It is hard then to see how to justify drawing a moral distinction between the two sorts of deception. The main difference seems to be that lying is usually easier to prove than cases of being economical with the truth.</p><p>For instance, if the police were to stop your car late at night and ask you if you had been drinking that evening and you were to answer 'No, not a drop', despite the fact that you had been drinking all afternoon (but not evening), then you would be guilty of deception even though you had not lied. A man who, in answer to the question 'Have you ever been unfaithful to me?' replies to his partner 'I swear I've never had sex with another woman', and isn't lying, is being economical with the truth if he has had sex with a man, and is deliberately concealing this fact by his answer.</p><p>Being economical with the truth is very different from mere forgetfulness.

This seems to be equivalent to saying that Pelé is mortal and that Pelé is not mortal: a bald <span class=\"target\">contradiction</span>. The answer is that the words 'mortal' and 'immortal' are being used in a confusing way that allows someone to be both without contradiction. 'Mortal' here means 'will die'; but 'immortal' does not refer to absence of bodily death, rather it refers to those whose fame will endure after they have died. When used in this way there is no contradiction in claiming both that a man will die and yet be immortal.</p><p>The second example provides a further example of equivocation. This time the word used in different senses is 'man': in the first premise, where it occurs in the plural, it is clearly intended to mean 'human beings'; in the second premise it is intended to mean 'male human being'. Both of these examples are somewhat far-fetched: they are deliberately paradoxical in their conclusions and unlikely to cause genuine confusion.</p><p>Consider another example, this time slightly more realistic. Someone might argue along these lines:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>It can never be right to deceive anyone deliberately.</div><div>So no one has a right to deceive anyone deliberately.</div></div><p>The first premise uses the word 'right' to mean 'morally right'; the second seems to be referring to legal rights, which, although related, are not the same sort of thing. Clearly many actions which are morally wrong are not forbidden by the law: for instance, it might be morally wrong to eat meat which has been cruelly produced, but, as things stand, you have a legal right to do so if you please. Moving in this way from what is morally right, to what you have a legal right to do is a form of equivocation. This sort of equivocation typically arises from carelessness; however, many instance of equivocation involve wilful misunderstanding (see also <span class=\"target\">straw man</span>).</p><p>If, for example, someone advocates equality as a political goal, it is highly unlikely that they intend 'equality' to be understood as meaning 'total uniformity'. The demand for equality is typically a demand for equality of treatment, equality of respect, equality of access to power, equality of opportunity, the discounting of irrelevant features, and so on. It is almost never a demand that everyone be given precisely the same treatment in every respect. Nor is its aim to create a world in which everyone is as close to identical as possible. Yet some critics of egalitarianism oscillate between interpreting 'equality' in the ways described above, and as 'uniformity'. Their argument typically takes the following form:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>You want equality (of treatment, respect, access to power, opportunity, etc.).</div><div>Equality (in the sense of complete uniformity) is an unachievable and undesirable goal.</div><div>Therefore what you desire is achievable and undesirable.</div></div><p>Stated in this way it is easy to see that this sort of criticism involves equivocation about the meaning of 'equality'.

Etymology is the study of the origin of words. This sort of move is sometimes informative, but is not at all reliable: because a word or phrase originally meant one thing, the <span class=\"target\">assumption</span> is that it will always keep that meaning, even when it forms only a part of a word and is used in a different context perhaps thousands of years later, often in ignorance of the original meaning. But etymological analysis is only <i>sometimes</i> of value in understanding contemporary meaning: it does not follow that because a word originally had one meaning that it will always continue to have that same meaning or even one directly related to it. Those who have spent many years perfecting their knowledge of ancient languages find the etymological fallacy extremely tempting and frequently succumb to it. Nevertheless etymology should only be used when it is genuinely illuminating. The trouble with it is that the meanings of words are not fixed entirely by their origins, though words often do preserve vestiges of their original meanings. The most reliable indicator of word's meaning is its current use rather than its derivation (see also <span class=\"target\">dictionary definition</span> and <span class=\"target\">stipulative definition</span>).</p><p>For instance, the word 'posthumous' is composed of two Latin words, 'post' meaning 'after' and 'humous' (humus) meaning 'earth' with the implication of burial in earth. 'Posthumous' is currently used to refer to a child born after its father's death, or else, more commonly, to a book published after its author's death. So the essential meaning is 'after death'. However, someone committing the etymological fallacy might insist that 'posthumous' couldn't accurately be used to refer to the offspring or writing of someone whose body was lost at sea, or cremated, because they wouldn't have been buried in earth. This would be <span class=\"target\">pedantry</span>. It would also betray an ignorance of the nature of language.</p><p>The word 'drab' originally meant 'female prostitute'. However, if somebody today describes a woman's clothes as drab, this merely refers to her dress sense rather than her profession. The word 'horror' comes from a Latin word which suggests the bristling of hairs in fright: this etymological fact is interesting and does largely coincide with current usage inasmuch as, for instance, a horror movie is the kind of movie designed to make the hairs on the back of your neck bristle. But the etymological fact in no way fixes the meaning for all time.</p><p>The etymological fallacy is sometimes committed in political speeches as a form of rhetoric. Speech-writers often begin by looking up the origin of a key word in a speech. They then elaborate on this to make the points required by their commission, purporting to unpack interesting meanings latent in the word in question. So, for example, someone advocating more extensive cross-party debate of political questions in the British Parliament might draw attention to the fact that the word 'Parliament' comes originally from the French word <i>parlement</i> meaning 'talking', and then use this to argue that <i>therefore</i> (a case of the <span class=\"target\">spurious 'therefore'</span>) there should be more discussion of issues in Parliament (see <span class=\"target\">bad reasons fallacy</span>).

There he purported to show the origins of key moral concepts in resentment and self-hatred. His idea was that by showing the historical origin of such altruistic emotions he had undermined the exalted place accorded to them in Christian morality. However, even if he was correct about the origins of these concepts it certainly would not follow that they are less important today because of their original source.</p><p>Bishop Wilberforce used the genetic fallacy for rhetorical effect (see <span class=\"target\">rhetoric</span>) when arguing against Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. In a public debate with Thomas Huxley, a defender of Darwin's ideas, he enquired on which side Huxley traced descent from monkeys, his grandmother's or his grandfather's.

First, it was a caricature of Darwin's views (see <span class=\"target\">straw man</span>), since Darwin claimed that human beings had ape-like creatures as immediate ancestors, not monkeys; he also claimed that the process of evolution was gradual, taking place over thousands of years rather than several generations. But the other, more basic, mistake was Wilberforce's assumption that whatever was descended from monkeys must be monkey-like. Whether it is or not depends entirely on the nature of the descent.</p><p>A common form of the genetic fallacy arises when people examine the origins of a word in order to determine its current meaning (see <span class=\"target\">etymological fallacy</span>). In this and all cases of the genetic fallacy, it may be true that there is some important link between the original and its descendant, but the mere genetic relation does not guarantee it.</p>"

        text: "<p>A rhetorical technique (see <span class=\"target\">rhetoric</span>) used to avoid answering awkward questions about what might happen. A hypothetical situation is one which might conceivably occur. So, for example, one hypothetical situation we might well find ourselves in is that the world's oceans and rivers become so polluted that it is no longer safe to eat fish caught in the wild. This is not actually the case now, but it could be the case in the future. Most planning for the future involves envisaging hypothetical situations and deciding how we might deal with them if faced with them in reality. Military training, for example, is based on anticipation of what might happen; a sports coach will usually run through a series of hypothetical situations before a big game in order to help players work out how they should react; civil engineers building a dam will base their calculations on informed hypotheses about projected rainfall and the likely water level; and so on.</p><p>However, some people in positions of authority have devised a way of avoiding commitment to particular courses of action. Whenever they are asked a question about what they would do in some hypothetical situation they respond that that is irrelevant and that they needn't answer questions about what <i>might</i> happen: they have to deal with the real world, not an imaginary one. In other words, they refuse to answer the question solely on the grounds that it is about a hypothetical situation. This is simply a rhetorical trick: the no hypothetical move. Obviously some questions about far-fetched hypothetical situations don't merit an answer (but even some of these do: see <span class=\"target\">thought experiments</span>).</p><p>For example, if someone asked 'What would you do if you discovered that the entire British Royal family were members of the Sicilian mafia?', very few people would see any point in venturing an opinion; the question is simply too far-fetched. But the question ' What will be the implications for the British constitution if the monarchy is abolished?' is a much more realistic one and certainly deserves an answer because it deals with possible situation. The answer to it is of great interest, and no doubt could affect those who are in a position to set in motion a chain of events which could culminate in the abolition of the monarchy. Dismissing the question as merely hypothetical and therefore not worth answering would be a straightforward case of avoiding an important issue.</p><p>Politicians, who are particularly prone to use the no hypotheticals move, should bear in mind that all policy statements express views about how a party will behave in a range of hypothetical situations (typically, for example, beginning with the hypothetical situation in which the party in question is elected to power). If they are prepared to deal with hypothetical situations in the context of policy-making then they need to have some further grounds for dismissing hypotheticals beyond the mere fact that hypotheticals deal with what might happen rather than what has actually happened (see consistency and <span class=\"target\">companions in guilt move</span>).</p>"

'Paradox' is a precise term in philosophy; in ordinary conversation 'paradoxical' is often used as a synonym for 'odd' or 'unexpected'. The philosophical use is narrower than this. Genuine paradoxes draw attention to inconsistencies in beliefs or anomalies in reasoning. They are often more than logical puzzles and have in many cases forced philosophers to revise their unquestioned <span class=\"target\">assumptions</span>.</p><p>An example of a paradox is the famous case known as the heap or sorites paradox ('<i>soros</i>' is Greek for heap). If 5,000 grains of salt make a heap, then taking away a single grain will still leave a heap. So with taking away a further grain. And another one. And another one. And so on. But if we apply this reasoning, in 4,999 steps we will be left with a single grain, which clearly isn't a heap. Presumably the heap ceased being a heap some time before getting down to the single grain. But when did this happen? Working back the other way: a single grain of salt isn't a heap; nor are two grains; nor three. So when do we get a heap? The paradox here is that if either removing or adding a grain of salt cannot cause something to become or cease to be a heap, it seems to follow that a single grain of salt must be a heap, since we can reduce any heap of salt to a single grain by a series of uncontroversial stages of removing single grains. Yet we know very well that a single grain of salt is not a heap.</p <p>One half-serious solution to this paradox is to point out that one grain can't be a heap. Nor can two or three: they can only make a triangle or a pillar of salt. But, since four grains can make a pyramid, then this is the point at which a collection of grains can become a heap. Neat as this solution is, it doesn't provide a solution to the many other instantiations of this paradox: the example of the heap is just an example. There are many other similarly vague terms (see <span class=\"target\">vagueness</span> and <span class=\"target\">drawing a line</span>), such as 'tall' and 'bald' for which there is no sharp boundary between possessing and not possessing this attribute. Reducing a tall woman's height by a millimetre isn't going to stop her being tall; plucking a single hair from a man's head isn't going to suddenly make him bald (unless you use 'bald' in an extremely precise sense to mean not having a single hair on one's head, rather than the vaguer way in which it is usually used).</p><p>In general we should reserve the word 'paradoxical' to describe genuine paradoxes rather than for merely odd or unusual circumstances. Otherwise we risk a loss in precision.

This sort of dichotomy suggests that there are only two options, one of which is unattractive; thus you should be persuaded to give money to the charity.

If you had good reasons to believe that, say, buying a particular type of car would catapult you into a world of beautiful people, then this wouldn't be merely rhetoric; there would be reasons for your belief.

        title: "slippery slope argument",
        text: "<p>A type of <span class=\"target\">argument</span> which relies on the <span class=\"target\">premise</span> that if you make a small move in a particular direction it may then be extremely difficult or even impossible to prevent a much more substantial move in the same direction (see also <span class=\"target\">domino effect</span>). If you take one step down a slippery slope you run the risk of finding yourself sliding downwards at an ever-increasing speed until you reach the bottom. The further down the slope you get the harder it is to stop. After a while you can't stop even if you desperately want to. This metaphor of a slippery slope is often used either explicitly or implicitly as a way of persuading people that the acceptance of one relatively innocuous practice will inevitably lead to the legitimation of highly undesirable practices.</p><p>For instance, using this style of argument, some people maintain that euthanasia should never be legalised in any form because that would involve taking the first step down a slippery slope which has at its bottom morally abhorrent practices such as murder and even genocide. You shouldn't take the first step unless you are prepared to descend rapidly towards this highly undesirable end point, it is alleged. In this particular case the argument is usually bolstered by appeal to a frightening precedent: the fact that some of the Nazi techniques of mass murder were first piloted as what was described as a form of euthanasia. The slippery slope argument suggests that were we to make any form of deliberate killing legal now we would very likely find ourselves moving helplessly down a steep slope towards the legalisation of less acceptable forms of killing until we ended up sanctioning murder and worse.</p><p>This form of argument can have some force, but in order to judge it we need extensive information about the alleged inevitability of the descent; it is not enough simply to claim that there is a slippery slope.  Typically, slippery slope arguments obscure the fact that in most cases we can decide how far down a slope we want to go: we can dig our heels in at a certain point and say 'here and no further'. And we can have very good reasons for this (see also <span class=\"target\">drawing a line</span>). The metaphor of slipperiness with its connotations of inevitable descent and frightening loss of control does not seem to allow this possibility. It conjures up images of powerlessness which may be inappropriate to the case in question. Sometimes slippery slope arguments are pure rhetoric designed to obscure the fact that the descent towards the worst possible scenario is by no means inevitable.</p><p>In its most extreme forms this kind of rhetoric can easily be ridiculed. Using the same sort of move it would seem to follow that if we eat at all we are in serious danger of eating more and more until we end up obese; if we tell a small white lie we will end up by betraying our country; if we permit a surgeon to perform minor operations without using anaesthetics we will be well on the way down a slippery slope which will end with the legalisation of human vivisection without anaesthetic. And so on. What these exaggerated examples demonstrate is that much more information about the kind of slope is needed before we can say that it is so slippery that the end result of the first step will be disaster. Slopes have different degrees of slipperiness and in most cases there are straightforward ways of avoiding the descent to the bottom. Even if actual slopes are hard to negotiate, the sort encountered in slippery slope arguments usually allow us to dig our heels in before we lose control.</p><p>The slippery slopes discussed so far all rely on <span class=\"target\">empirical</span> questions about the alleged inevitability of descent. Some slippery slope arguments also rely on a logical point about how if one small move in a particular direction is justified then any number of such small moves must also be justified (see <span class=\"target\">drawing a line</span>).</p><p>A different metaphor sometimes used as an alternative to the slippery slope is that of the thin end of the wedge. Once a wedge has been inserted in a crack it can usually be pushed further and further in until the thicker end has prised open the crack. Here the thick end of the wedge represents an undesirable end point. The metaphor of the slope suggests loss of control; that of the wedge an irresistible force. In both cases the sense of inevitability created may be inappropriate to the case in question, and the use of such metaphors should alert you to the possibility that you are being persuaded by rhetoric rather than argument.</p><p>It is worth noting that the term 'slippery slope' is almost always used by critics of an argument rather than by its defenders, and that it can itself be a rhetorical device used to caricature an opponent's argument (see <span class=\"target\">straw man</span>).</p>"

For example, those who fall for this fallacy might claim that unless you can give a completely watertight definition of 'off side' in soccer, you won't be able to identify particular instances of a player being off side. Yet it should be obvious that very few footballers and football fans would find it easy to give a precise definition of 'off side'. yet are very skilled at recognising whether or not a player actually is off side. Or, to take another example, most of us feel confident to declare certain individuals beautiful despite being unable to give a precise definition of 'beauty'.</p><p>It is clear that being able to give precise definitions of some concepts may on occasion be extremely useful in deciding whether or not borderline cases fall within the concept. However, we are usually able to recognise what something is without being able to give a very precise definition of the concept within which it falls. This may be because the type of concept defies definition in terms of <span class=\"target\">necessary and sufficient conditions</span>: it might be what the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein dubbed a '<span class=\"target\">family resemblance term</span>'. For example, Wittgenstein thought that 'game' was a family resemblance term: there is no common defining essence of all games, merely a pattern of overlapping and criss-crossing resemblances between the things which merit the label game.

To avoid confusion it is often necessary to make clear precisely what you mean by a particular word or phrase.

Usually this means giving a narrower or at least more selective definition than is found in the dictionary. It would be absurd to stop to give definitions of all the important terms in an <span class=\"target\">argument</span>. In order to communicate at all we need to make many <span class=\"target\">assumptions</span> about shared linguistic knowledge and beliefs. However, particularly in the realm of <span class=\"target\">empirical</span> research, stipulative definitions of key terms can prevent confusion.</p><p>For instance, a team of psychologists conducting research in education might stipulate that when they describe someone as 'intelligent' what they mean, for the purposes of the research project, is that this person is capable of scoring more than 100 on an IQ test. The word 'intelligence' is somewhat vague unless given a precise definition or used in a context where one is implied. Giving a stipulative definition here avoids confusion by making explicit how these researchers are using the term. However, sometimes use of stipulative definitions can lead to misunderstandings. If someone were to read the psychologists' report in the above example forgetting that the word 'intelligent' was being used in this way, they would, quite reasonably, understand the term in a more colloquial sense. The result would be a failure of communication. Such misunderstandings are most likely to occur when stipulative definitions are given for words which are in common use and when the stipulated definitions differ significantly from the everyday ones.</p><p>It is important to realise that words in common use are difficult to rid of their typical associations and that many readers will quickly revert to the more common use of a term unless frequently reminded of the stipulated definition. 'Poverty', for instance, is a highly <span class=\"target\">emotive</span> word suggesting extreme want and lack of basic necessities such as food, shelter and clothing. Some sociologists, however, use the term in a different way, stipulating that poverty is always relative to the typical social needs of a particular society. Using this stipulated definition it may turn out that someone in contemporary Britain who cannot afford to own a colour television set is for this reason to be considered to be in a state of poverty. Yet when the results of this sort of sociological investigation into poverty are published in daily newspapers, most readers find it difficult to keep in mind the special definition of 'poverty' being used. Words are stubborn: they resist having their everyday meaning wrenched from them, and in many cases it is better to coin a new term than to stipulate an unusual meaning for an old one (see also <span class=\"target\">humptydumptying</span>).</p>"

The response 'That's a value judgement' may then be heard. But the person using the words 'great play' undoubtedly realises that he or she is making a value judgement: that is the point of the statement. If the responder's implicit view is that it is a mistaken value judgment, then the onus is on him or her to provide evidence to back up this claim. Simply declaring that a judgement has been made in no way refutes the particular judgement, nor in most cases does it rule it out of court. Similarly, the person who declares <i>King Lear</i> 'a great play' needs to provide some evidence to support this view.</p><p>The idea that we should not make value judgements is not an easy position to defend in any context since almost every aspect of our lives which we are likely to argue about is infused with values: we make implicit value judgements in nearly everything we say. There is rarely any justification for deeming value judgements impermissible. The statement 'that's a value judgement' can itself be construed as a value judgement: it is a judgement that what has just been said is worthless because it makes a value judgement.

Imagine that it is possible to plug yourself into an experience machine, a type of virtual reality machine which gives you the illusion of actually living your life but with the added twist that everything that you do or happens to you is intensely pleasurable. Whatever pleases you in real life can be simulated in its most pleasurable form in the experience machine; once you are plugged into it you will believe that all these pleasurable events are really taking place. Would you willingly plug into such a machine for the rest of your life? If, as in most cases, the answer is no, this suggests that you value some things more than just unlimited pleasurable experience, though you may not have realised this until you conducted the thought experiment.</p><p>The thought experiment of the experience machine is obviously far-fetched; it is very unlikely that such a machine will exist in our lifetimes. But that doesn't matter. The point of it is to pick out our fundamental attitude to pleasure, and it is good at making clear our intuitions on this. Consequently, to dismiss it simply because it is far-fetched is to miss its point. The real issue is not whether we would voluntarily plug ourselves into an experience machine, it is whether we really do value pleasure above alll other things in life.

This isn't true of all dogs, and certainly isn't true of all human beings (see <span class=\"target\">some/all confusion</span>): there are many older people who are capable of making radical leaps in their ability.

        text: "<p>Taking statements to be true simply because an alleged authority on the matter has said that they are true. There are very good reasons for deferring to experts on a wide range of matters. Life is too short, and intellectual ability too varied for everyone to be an expert on everything. There is a division of intellectual labour which makes it sensible to seek the views of experts when we move into a realm in which we have little reason to feel confident about our own knowledge and opinions.</p><p>For instance, if I break a bone in my leg, although I have some vague notions of the best way to treat it, I would surely do better to seek expert medical advice from a doctor who has experience of the different kinds of fractures and has had the benefit of years of study of medicine than to rely on my uninformed hunches about the nature of my ailment. The doctor would be able to determine whether I have in fact broken my leg, or just bruised it it badly; whether it is most likely to set correctly if put into plaster, or whether it should simply be rested, and so on. However, it isn't simply because the doctor claims to be an authority on fractures that what he or she says about my case is likely to be true; it is because the doctor reaches a conclusion on the basis of sound reasoning and medical knowledge, reasoning and knowledge which other doctors would be in a position to assess and, possibly, contest. Because I don't have the relevant medical knowledge have to rely on the authority of the doctor's diagnosis, just as when I need legal advice I rely on a lawyer's assessment of the situation because I don't have a detailed enough knowledge of the law to be confident in my own judgements on the matter.</p><p>In such cases we seek out experts who have had the relevant training and whose performance is monitored by a professional body; that is why we feel confident to rely on their judgement. However, even in these cases a level of scepticism may be appropriate. Doctors and lawyers do not always agree, and where you suspect that the expert's opinion may be based on false premises, faulty reasoning or vested interests it is as well to seek a second opinion.</p><p>In some other cases, deference to experts may be entirely inappropriate (see <span class=\"target\">kowtowing</span>). One particularly dangerous psychological tendency that many people have is to put confidence in the views of authorities even when they are speaking on topics outside their area of specialization. For instance, a Nobel-prize-winning physicist might be taken seriously by some when he or she speaks on the decline of morality (see <span class=\"target\">universal expertise</span>). Deference to experts is also inappropriate when seeking the truth on controversial issues where there is no consensus among the experts. For instance on many such questions in politics and philosophy it would be ridiculous to cite the authority of a famous political theorist or philosopher who has held the view you want to endorse if your aim is to provide evidence for the truth of that view. In controversies there will be numerous authorities which could be cited to disprove any particular side. Some philosophers seem to think that it is sufficient to show that Ludwig Wittgenstein (a famous twentieth-century philosopher) endorsed a particular view to prove that that view is true. But from the fact that Wittgenstein believed that something was true we cannot simply conclude that therefore it must be true (see <span class=\"target\">spurious 'therefore'</span> and <span class=\"target\">spurious 'so'</span>). In order to assess the truth of what he claimed it would be necessary to examine his reasons for claiming it and to examine the views which other philosophers have put up against him. Citing the authority of a philosopher iS unlike citing the authority of a medical expert since in philosophy, unlike in medicine, most views are strongly contested.</p><p>The principal difficulty for someone faced with an expert's opinion is to decide how much weight to give it. The main points to bear in mind are that even if you establish that someone really is an expert in the field, he or she is still fallible; that experts often disagree with each other, particularly in areas where the evidence is inconclusive; and that, as mentioned above, experts are usually only experts in a relatively narrow area and so their pronouncements on areas outside their expertise should not be taken as seriously as those they make on their areas of expertise.</p>"

        text: "<p>Taking statements to be true simply because they are generally agreed upon. This is not a reliable way of discovering the truth on most issues; just because there is general agreement that something is true it doesn't follow that it <i>is</i> true.</p><p>For instance, in the fourteenth century there was general consensus that the world was flat, but it doesn't follow from the fact that most people thought it was flat that it actually <i>was</i> flat. Only an extreme relativist about truth would want to maintain that. If the experts of the day believe something to be the case, this may make it likely that what they believe is true, or approaches the truth (see <span class=\"target\">truth by authority<pan class=\"target\">></span>>). However, it is not the fact that they believe it that makes it true, rather the truth of their belief depends on whether or not it matches up with the way the world is. Even if experts in a particular field happen to agree about something it doesn't follow that what they agree about must be true, though if you are not an expert it would be appropriate to treat the consensus view of experts very seriously. But when the people in agreement aren't experts, and some of them know very little about the matter in question, there is no good reason for treating their consensus as an indicator of truth.</p><p>One reason why consensus isn't a reliable indicator of truth is that people are often very gullible: they are easily misled about all kinds of things, as any confidence trickster knows. What's more, most of us are prone to <span class=\"target\">wishful thinking</span> of various kinds. We believe what we wish were true, even if this doesn't match up to the facts, and sometimes even in the face of overwhelming evidence against our cherished beliefs.</p><p>Where there is no consensus, an even less reliable method of determining the truth is to rely simply on majority opinion. On most important questions the majority of people are ill-informed on what is at stake; it is surely better to rely on a minority of experts who have had time to study the available data rather than the hastily formed views of the majority. For instance, it may be that the majority of the world's population today believe that our destiny is completely determined by astrological considerations. But most of the people who believe this have such a sketchy knowledge of astronomy that their views are of little significance in determining whether or not the positions of stars determine our behaviour. Consequently when someone begins a sentence, 'It is generally agreed that' or 'Most people believe that' you should determine precisely what work is meant to be done by this phrase. Why does it matter what is generally agreed? Are we supposed to conclude that because most people believe something then it must be true? (Of course, it might be true, but if the reason for believing it to be true is because most other people believe it to be true, this is an unsatisfactory justification, see <span class=\"target\">bad reasons fallacy</span>.)</p><p>It is important not to confuse this attack on the belief in truth by consensus or truth by majority opinion with an attack on democratic decision-making. The reason why democratic decision procedures are often preferable to other alternatives is not that they reliably give true answers to questions, but that they allow for equal participation of different interest groups and usually provide ways of minimising the power of would-be tyrants (but see <span class=\"target\">democratic fallacy</span>).</p>"

We should take very seriously any pronouncements he made on physics, and indeed on related topics. But there is no reason to think that because he was a genius as a physicist his comments on the nature of society should be treated as authoritative. There is no obvious connection between the study of physics andthe study of human society. Certainly he was a highly intelligent man; but the shortness of a human life means that many highly intelligent people are relatively poorly informed on a wide range of issues.

Validity should not be confused with truth. Validity is always a quality of the structure of arguments; statements are true or false. Arguments can never be true or false, statements never valid or invalid (except when using the words 'valid' and 'invalid' in a colloquial sense in which they are synonymous with 'true' and 'false' as in the sentence 'The prime minister's statement that taxes are far too high is valid'). Only deductive arguments can be valid or invalid.</p><p>For instance, consider the following argument:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>If the fire alarm rings everyone should walk to the nearest exit.</div><div>The fire alarm is ringing.</div><div>So everyone should walk to the nearest exit.</div></div><p>The form of this argument is:</p><div class=\"ml-3 mb-2\"><div>If <i>p</i> then <i>q</i></div><div><i>p</i></div><div>Therefore <i>q</i></div></div><p>The letters <i>p</i> and <i>q</i> are standing in for any cases that you might want to insert into the argument.
