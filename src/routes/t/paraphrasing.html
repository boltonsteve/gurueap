<div>Many more species are at risk of extinction than scientists thought. That is because some species depend on another for their survival, so if one disappears, many more that have gone largely unnoticed by conservationists will follow. There are 12,200 species at risk according to the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List, the definitive audit of rare, threatened and endangered species. The true number, however, is likely to be much higher, says a team led by Liam Pin Koh at the National University of Singapore (Young, 2004, p.12).</div>

<div>Over the past few years, financial services and technology have overshadowed traditional manufacturing and mining as key sectors of the economy. This has been reflected in the composition of share markets across the world. Despite these trends, manufacturing is still an important part of the economy, particularly in servicing the building, housing, mining, automotive and rural industries (Gordon, 2004, p.45).</div>

<div>Trade in the necessities of life such as food and simple tools is probably at least as old as our species. What is particularly surprising, however, is that our taste for objects with no obvious survival value – trinkets, luxury items and ‘prestige goods’ – also goes way back. Recent findings in Africa suggest that decorative objects were being manufactured and traded more than 100,000 years ago (Douglas, 2004, p25).</div> 

<div>Although examples of management practice can be traced back several thousand years, the development of management as a field of knowledge is recent. Much of the impetus for developing management theories and principles came from the Industrial Revolution and the factory growth in the early 1800’s. With factories came a widespread need to coordinate large numbers of people in producing goods (Bartol et al, 2001, p.33).</div>
