That is because some species depend on another for their survival, so if one disappears, many more that have gone largely unnoticed by conservationists will follow. There are 12,200 species at risk according to the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List, the definitive audit of rare, threatened and endangered species. The true number, however, is likely to be much higher, says a team led by Liam Pin Koh at the National University of Singapore (Young, 2004, p.12).';

This under-counting has occurred, he says, because conservationists have not recognised the dependence of some species on other endangered species. Once these have become extinct, these other species will also disappear.';
